This is an archive of bibliographies for several topics including genetics, molecular genetics, genomics, applied sciences, machine learning.

# How to use .bib files
These files contain bibtex keys. The identifying keys are imported in all citation managers. Consequently, they can be generated from the same applications. For example, Google scholar can export citations as bibtex keys.
