From 7,734 ESTs annotated with SSR motives, 75 putative EST-SSRs were selected according their repetitive {DNA} sequence and functional annotation (Gene ontology), of these, 15 were characterized on 45 individuals of two wild populations located in two different biogeographic transition zones of the coast of Chile (30 and 42°S). Most loci were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and the polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.243 to 0.634. Pairwise F st between sampled populations was estimated in 0.478. These EST-SSR markers promise to be useful for future management strategies of this overexploited species.},

  Abstract                 = {The year was 1989 and Stephen Altschul had a problem. Sam Karlin, the brilliant mathematician whose help he needed, was so convinced of the power of a mathematically tractable but biologically constrained measure of protein sequence similarity that he would not listen to Altschul (or anyone else for that matter). So Altschul essentially tricked him into solving the problem stymying the field of computational biology by posing it in terms of pure mathematics, devoid of any reference to biology. The treat from that trick became known as the Karlin-Altschul statistics that are a key part of BLAST, arguably the most successful piece of computational biology software of all time.
Nature Biotechnology spoke with Altschul and several other originators of computational biology software programs widely used today (Table 1). The conversations explored what makes certain software tools successful, the unique challenges of developing them for biological research and how the field of computational biology, as a whole, can move research agendas forward. What follows is an edited compilation of interviews.},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSIBLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of increasing concentrations of Vibrio alginolyticus on survival of \textit{Mytilus galloprovincialis} larvae was studied in a 48 h static bioassay in 1 l glass bottles. Five bacterial densities were tested ranging from 10(2) to 10(6) bacteria ml(-1). Larval survival and normality (veliger larvae with the typical D-shape) were evaluated after 48 h. An inverse relationship between bacterial concentration and larval survival and normality was observed. In spite of high larval survival (79\%) under conditions of high bacterial density (10(5) bacteria ml(-1)), the percent of normal larvae was 11\%. Besides an irregular shape, abnormal larvae also presented velum reduction. Results from this study suggest that concentrations of V. alginolyticus lower than 10(3) bacteria ml(-1) should be maintained during \textit{M. galloprovincialis} larval culture.},

  Abstract                 = {Collagens are thought to represent one of the most important molecular innovations in the metazoan line. Basement membrane type IV collagen is present in all Eumetazoa and was found in Homoscleromorpha, a sponge group with a well-organized epithelium, which may represent the first stage of tissue differentiation during animal evolution. In contrast, spongin seems to be a demosponge-specific collagenous protein, which can totally substitute an inorganic skeleton, such as in the well-known bath sponge. In the freshwater sponge Ephydatia mülleri, we previously characterized a family of short-chain collagens that are likely to be main components of spongins. Using a combination of sequence- and structure-based methods, we present evidence of remote homology between the carboxyl-terminal noncollagenous NC1 domain of spongin short-chain collagens and type IV collagen. Unexpectedly, spongin short-chain collagen–related proteins were retrieved in nonsponge animals, suggesting that a family related to spongin constitutes an evolutionary sister to the type IV collagen family. Formation of the ancestral NC1 domain and divergence of the spongin short-chain collagen–related and type IV collagen families may have occurred before the parazoan–eumetazoan split, the earliest divergence among extant animal phyla. Molecular phylogenetics based on NC1 domain sequences suggest distinct evolutionary histories for spongin short-chain collagen–related and type IV collagen families that include spongin short-chain collagen–related gene loss in the ancestors of Ecdyzosoa and of vertebrates. The fact that a majority of invertebrates encodes spongin short-chain collagen–related proteins raises the important question to the possible function of its members. Considering the importance of collagens for animal structure and substratum attachment, both families may have played crucial roles in animal diversification.},

  Abstract                 = {Successful bivalve larval growth and survival depend on stored reserves provided by diet. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of microalgal diet on growth, survival, together with biochemical and fatty acid composition during larval development in grooved carpet shell (Ruditapes decussatus). Four mono- and multi-species diets were tested: (1) Isochrysis galbana, Pavlova lutheri and Chaetoceros muelleri (1:1:1, IPC); (2) I. galbana, P. lutheri and C. muelleri (1:1:2, IP2C); (3) I. galbana and P. lutheri (1:1, IP); (4) C. muelleri (C). Our results showed that feeding regime greatly influenced larval growth and survival, as well as biochemical and fatty acid composition. Higher growth and survival rates were observed in the IPC, IP2C and C diets, which all include C. muelleri. Despite the fact that the larvae fed with IP exhibited the lowest length at settlement and survival, they stored more total lipids than any of the diets including C. muelleri. The IP and IPC diets exhibited a higher percentage of total lipids, whereas IP2C and C showed a higher proportion of proteins. Lipid and carbohydrate concentrations in these diets negatively affected growth and growth and survival of the larvae, respectively. Protein content of the larvae was however positively related to larval survival, whereas lipid content of the larvae negatively affected growth. Fatty acid (FA) profile of neutral lipids (NL) and polar lipids (PL) of 22-day-old larvae clearly reflected the FA proportion of each diet. Dietary DHA and DHA in NL of the larvae were negatively related to larvae growth. DHA incorporation into PL in larvae fed with DHA-deficient diets was compensated by an enrichment in EPA, 18:0dma, 22:5(n-3) and 22:2 non-methylene-interrupted dienoic FA. According to these results, the presence of C. muelleri in the diet seems to promote better growth and survival of R. decussatus larvae.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the development of the immune system during the larval stages of the mussel \textit{Mytilus galloprovincialis}. The ability of trochophore and veliger larvae to phagocytose foreign particles (Escherichia coli and zymosan) was measured. Phagocytosis was detected as early as 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. However, although there was a high basal production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and NRS), the phagocytosis of zymosan did not trigger an associated increase in radical production. In addition, a panel of immune-related mussel genes (Myticin B, Myticin C, Mytilin B, Mytimycin precursor 1, Macrophage migration inhibition factor, lysozyme, C1q, membrane attack complex protein and fibrinogen-related protein) was selected for expression profile analysis throughout the different developmental stages (trochophore, veliger, metamorphosis, post-settlement and spat). The expression of these genes increased during the transition from trochophore to spat, and the level of expression was higher in oocytes than in trochophores, suggesting that gene expression during the first larval stages might be maternal in origin. Metamorphosis was identified as a crucial stage when larvae increased the expression of immune-related genes and responded to environmental signals. Whole-mount in situ hybridization studies showed the mantle edge as an important area in the development of immunocompetence in bivalve larvae. Larvae responded to both live and heat-inactivated bacteria by modulating expression of immune-related genes. Altogether, our results support that during the early stages of \textit{M. galloprovincialis} development, immune mechanisms emerge to aid larvae in managing infections.},

  Abstract                 = {The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) is one of the most serious rice plant pests in Asia. N. lugens causes extensive rice damage by sucking rice phloem sap, which results in stunted plant growth and the transmission of plant viruses. Despite the importance of this insect pest, little is known about the immunological mechanisms occurring in this hemimetabolous insect species. Results
In this study, we performed a genome- and transcriptome-wide analysis aiming at the immune-related genes. The transcriptome datasets include the N. lugens intestine, the developmental stage, wing formation, and sex-specific expression information that provided useful gene expression sequence data for the genome-wide analysis. As a result, we identified a large number of genes encoding N. lugens pattern recognition proteins, modulation proteins in the prophenoloxidase (proPO) activating cascade, immune effectors, and the signal transduction molecules involved in the immune pathways, including the Toll, Immune deficiency (Imd) and Janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathways. The genome scale analysis revealed detailed information of the gene structure, distribution and transcription orientations in scaffolds. A comparison of the genome-available hemimetabolous and metabolous insect species indicate the differences in the immune-related gene constitution. We investigated the gene expression profiles with regards to how they responded to bacterial infections and tissue, as well as development and sex expression specificity. Conclusions
The genome- and transcriptome-wide analysis of immune-related genes including pattern recognition and modulation molecules, immune effectors, and the signal transduction molecules involved in the immune pathways is an important step in determining the overall architecture and functional network of the immune components in N. lugens. Our findings provide the comprehensive gene sequence resource and expression profiles of the immune-related genes of N. lugens, which could facilitate the understanding of the innate immune mechanisms in the hemimetabolous insect species. These data give insight into clarifying the potential functional roles of the immune-related genes involved in the biological processes of development, reproduction, and virus transmission in N. lugens.},

  Abstract                 = {Larvae of the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, rely on external chemical cues to trigger metamorphosis; thus, the timing of metamorphosis is depedent upon the larva's chance encounter with the appropriate substrate. We examined the effect of the timing of metamorphosis on the development of the central nervous system (CNS), concentrating on the pattern of serotonin and small cardioactive peptide- (SCP) immunopositive neurons in the cerebral ganglia. By 4 days postfertilization the cerebral ganglion has five pairs of serotonin-immunoreactive (IR) neurons, one pair of which (the V cells) innervate the velum. This complement of cells remains stable for as long as the larval stage persists but metamorphosis causes the rapid loss of the V cells. In the case of SCP-IR neurons, one pair is present prior to metamorphic competency, but as larvae continue to age in the absence of inducing cues, additional pairs are gradually added. Metamorphosis causes an acceleration in SCP-IR neuron addition. This separation of developmental patterns is well adapted for the inherent uncertainty of the timing of metamorphosis in abalone larvae. © 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the increasing production of nanoparticles (NPs) and their potential release in the aquatic environment, evaluation of their biological impact on aquatic organisms represents a major concern. Suspension feeding invertebrates, in particular bivalve mollusks, may play a role in NP biotransformation and transfer through food webs and may represent a significant target for NP toxicity.
In this work, the \textit{in vivo} effects of titanium dioxide (n-TiO2), one of the most widespread NPs in use, were investigated in the bivalve \textit{Mytilus galloprovincialis}, largely utilised as a sentinel for marine contamination. Mussels were exposed for 96 h to different concentrations of n-TiO2 suspensions (1, 10 and 100 ?g L?1) and multiple responses were evaluated in the digestive gland and immune cells, the haemocytes. In the digestive gland, n-TiO2 affected lysosomal and oxidative stress biomarkers and decreased transcription of antioxidant and immune-related genes. In the haemocytes, n-TiO2 decreased lysosomal membrane stability-LMS and phagocytosis, increased oxyradical production and transcription of antimicrobial peptides; moreover, pre-apoptotic processes were observed. The effects of n-TiO2 on digestive gland and haemocytes were distinct, also depending on the endpoint and on nominal NP concentrations, with many significant responses elicited by the lowest concentrations tested. The results show that n-TiO2, at concentrations close to predicted environmental levels, significantly affected different functional and molecular parameters of mussel digestive gland and immune cells. In particular, the observed changes in immune parameters that represent significant biomarkers of exposure at the organism level suggest that exposure to n-TiO2 may pose a serious risk to mussel health.},

  Abstract                 = {Oceans face a serious change to their natural biogeochemical cycle due to the rapid absorption of CO2 generated by human activities. Ocean acidification is the common term used to describe the decrease of seawater pH caused by the absorption of atmospheric CO2. To evaluate the effects of ocean acidification, we focused on the larval stage of bivalves, which produce a fragile calcareous skeletal structure, very sensitive to changes in seawater chemistry. In this context, we investigated sperm motility, fertilization rate and larval viability (survival, growth and abnormalities) of the {Pacific} oyster, Crassostrea gigas, a commercially important bivalve, in a controlled CO2 perturbation experiment. The carbonate chemistry of seawater was manipulated by diffusing pure CO2, to attain two reduced pH levels (?pH = ? 0.4 and ?pH = ? 0.7) which were compared to unmanipulated seawater. The results show high sensitivity of C. gigas veliger larvae to low values of pH, as reflected by a decrease in survival and growth rates, as well as an increased frequency of prodissoconch abnormalities and protruding mantle. Moreover, results also show that sperm motility, fertilization rate, and hatching success, were negatively influenced by acidification. The exposure to ?pH = ? 0.7 had a higher impact on the fertilization and larval viability than ?pH = ? 0.4. The results suggest that the reproductive success and the biological mechanisms for calcification may be prematurely interrupted and disturbed when C. gigas veliger larvae are exposed to an acidified environment which may reduce their viability and compromise settlement and future abundances of this species.},

  Abstract                 = {Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a member of TLR family. It recognizes a wide range of bacteria and their products, and is involved in inducing innate immune responses. In this article, we reported inductive expression of TLR2 and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent signaling in the Indian major carp, mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala) which is highly commercially important fish species in the Indian subcontinent. Ontogeny analysis of TLR2, MyD88 and TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6) genes by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed constitutive expression of these genes in all embryonic developmental stages, indicating their involvement in embryonic innate immune defense system in fish. Tissue specific expression analysis of these genes by qRT-PCR showed their wide distribution in various organs and tissues. Highest expression of TLR2 was in gill, MyD88 in liver and TRAF6 was in kidney. Inductive expression of TLR2, MyD88 and TRAF6 genes were observed following peptidoglycan (PGN)-treatment, and Streptococcus uberis and Aeromonas hydrophila infections. Expression of interleukin (IL)-8 and TNF-? in various organs were significantly enhanced by PGN-treatment and bacterial infections, and were closely associated with TLR2 induction. These findings together highlighted the contribution of TLR2 in augmenting innate immunity in fish, and indicated it’s important role in immune surveillance of various organs during pathogenic invasion. This study will enrich the information in understanding the innate immune mechanism in fish, and will be helpful in developing preventive measures against infectious diseases in fish.},

We continue to improve the Pfam website and add new visualizations, such as the ‘sunburst’ representation of taxonomic distribution of families. In this work we additionally address two topics that will be of particular interest to the Pfam community. First, we explain the definition and use of family-specific, manually curated gathering thresholds. Second, we discuss some of the features of domains of unknown function (also known as DUFs), which constitute a rapidly growing class of families within Pfam.},

  Abstract                 = {A single cohort of small individuals (31 mm mean shell length, 112 mg mean dry flesh weight) of the marine bivalve mollusc \textit{Mytilus galloprovincialis} Lmk. was held sequentially for 2 wk at each of four food levels equivalent to ingested rations of less than 0.1\%, 2.6\%, 3.1\%, and 7.4\% of dry body weight per day. Growth rate reached a maximum at the highest ration level and was strongly correlated, amongst individuals, with mean heterozygosity measured across nine enzyme loci. Rates of energy expenditure were analysed separately as maintenance metabolic rate and the energy costs of growth (J mg-1 dry tissue). The maintenance metabolic rate correlated with traits of protein metabolism (protein synthesis, deposition, and breakdown), and the separate energy costs of both maintenance and growth correlated with the efficiency of protein deposition (protein growth as a proportion of synthesis). The energy costs of growth also varied in negative relation to mean individual heterozygosity. In a multiple regression analysis, the energy allocation to the costs of growth, body size, mean heterozygosity, and the efficiency of protein deposition together explained 90\% of the variance amongst individuals in observed rates of growth. The results support the hypothesis that individual variability in the energy costs of protein turnover and in the efficiency of protein deposition during rapid growth are significant factors providing a link between individual genotype and its phenotypic expression as growth.},

  Abstract                 = {A major impediment to understanding the impact of environmental stress, including toxins and other pollutants, on organisms, is that organisms are rarely challenged by one or a few stressors in natural systems. Thus, linking laboratory experiments that are limited by practical considerations to a few stressors and a few levels of these stressors to real world conditions is constrained. In addition, while the existence of complex interactions among stressors can be identified by current statistical methods, these methods do not provide a means to construct mathematical models of these interactions. In this paper, we offer a two-step process by which complex interactions of stressors on biological systems can be modeled in an experimental design that is within the limits of practicality. We begin with the notion that environment conditions circumscribe an n-dimensional hyperspace within which biological processes or end points are embedded. We then randomly sample this hyperspace to establish experimental conditions that span the range of the relevant parameters and conduct the experiment(s) based upon these selected conditions. Models of the complex interactions of the parameters are then extracted using machine learning tools, specifically artificial neural networks. This approach can rapidly generate highly accurate models of biological responses to complex interactions among environmentally relevant toxins, identify critical subspaces where nonlinear responses exist, and provide an expedient means of designing traditional experiments to test the impact of complex mixtures on biological responses. Further, this can be accomplished with an astonishingly small sample size. © 2013 {American} Chemical Society.},

  Abstract                 = {The hypobranchial gland present in gastropods is an organ whose function is not clearly understood. Involved in mucus production, within members of the family Muricidae it is also the source of the ancient dye Tyrian purple and its bioactive precursors. To gain further insights into hypobranchial gland biology, suppressive subtractive hybridisation was performed on hypobranchial gland and mantle tissue from the marine snail Dicathais orbita creating a differentially expressed c{DNA} library. 437 clones were randomly sequenced, analysed and annotated and 110 sequences had their functions putatively identified. Importantly this approach identified a putative gene involved in Tyrian purple biosynthesis, an arylsulphatase gene. Confirmation of the upregulation of arylsulphatase in the hypobranchial gland compared to the mantle was demonstrated using quantitative real-time PCR. Other genes identified as playing an important role in the hypobranchial gland were those involved in mucus protein synthesis, choline ester regulation, protein and energy production. This study confirms that the hypobranchial gland is involved in the production of mucus secretion and also identifies it as a site of chemical interaction and biosynthesis. This study lays the foundation for a better understanding of the enzymatic production of Tyrian purple precursors within the gland.},

  Abstract                 = {RNA-seq, a massive parallel-sequencing-based transcriptome profiling method, provides digital data in the form of aligned sequence read counts. The comparative analyses of the data require appropriate statistical methods to estimate the differential expression of transcript variants across different cell/tissue types and disease conditions.
We developed a novel nonparametric empirical Bayesian-based approach (NPEBseq) to model the RNA-seq data. The prior distribution of the Bayesian model is empirically estimated from the data without any parametric assumption, and hence the method is nonparametric in nature. Based on this model, we proposed a method for detecting differentially expressed genes across different conditions. We also extended this method to detect differential usage of exons from {RNA-seq} data. The evaluation of NPEBseq on both simulated and publicly available {RNA-seq} datasets and comparison with three popular methods showed improved results for experiments with or without biological replicates.
NPEBseq can successfully detect differential expression between different conditions not only at gene level but also at exon level from {RNA-seq} datasets. In addition, NPEBSeq performs significantly better than current methods and can be applied to genome-wide {RNA-seq} datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {\textit{in vitro} cell culture systems from molluscs have significantly contributed to our basic understanding of complex physiological processes occurring within or between tissue-specific cells, yielding information unattainable using intact animal models. \textit{in vitro} cultures of neuronal cells from gastropods show how simplified cell models can inform our understanding of complex networks in intact organisms. Primary cell cultures from marine and freshwater bivalve and gastropod species are used as biomonitors for environmental contaminants, as models for gene transfer technologies, and for studies of innate immunity and neoplastic disease. Despite efforts to isolate proliferative cell lines from molluscs, the snail Biomphalaria glabrata (Say, 1818) embryonic (Bge) cell line is the only existing cell line originating from any molluscan species. Taking an organ systems approach, this review summarizes efforts to establish molluscan cell cultures and describes the varied applications of primary cell cultures in research. Because of the unique status of the Bge cell line, an account is presented of the establishment of this cell line, and of how these cells have contributed to our understanding of snail host – parasite interactions. Finally, we detail the difficulties commonly encountered in efforts to establish cell lines from molluscs and discuss how these difficulties might be overcome.},

  Abstract                 = {Bivalves share many of the “deeper” questions with the other molluscan groups - issues such as their origin and sister-group relationships within the Mollusca, and their suitability to explore molecular data in a “known” fossil framework. Other questions are more specific to bivalves, a group that radiated so successfully and nowadays predominantly specializes as infaunal and sessile epifaunal suspension feeders. This paper highlights and explores unanswered questions, from the seemingly trivial and mundane (e.g., how many species are actually out there?), to exploring enigmatic clades about which we know extremely little besides their shells, to macroevolutionary questions that could best be addressed by bivalve-based data. Fast-developing molecular approaches, including the first genome-level and transcriptomic data, a resurgence of detailed morphological and soft-anatomical research, and a renewed focus on Bivalvia by biological and paleontological workers provide us with an opportunity to address such issues. Coordination of efforts - and reciprocal illumination - across traditional disciplinary boundaries will be key factors in such endeavors.},

  Abstract                 = {We developed a multilocus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-barcoding approach to identify newly transformed juvenile mussels collected from naturally infested fishes in a federally protected waterway that is home to a diverse mussel community, the St Croix River (Minnesota/Wisconsin, USA). We used new and publicly available data downloaded from GenBank to build reference databases for identified adult mussels. We assessed the efficacy of the mitochondrial loci cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) for {DNA }barcoding. We concluded that the barcoding gap between average intra- and interspecific genetic distances is wider for ND1 than for COI, but both loci perform well for species identification in character-based phylogenetic analyses. Almost every species formed a monospecific clade with high bootstrap and posterior-probability support. We obtained newly transformed juvenile mussels by collecting individuals of 3 different fish species that were infested with unionid larvae. We held the fish in aquaria until the mussels emerged naturally. We then extracted {DNA }and sequenced our loci of interest. When sequences from the juveniles were included in phylogenetic analyses, they grouped with single species (or, in one case, a pair of closely related species) with high bootstrap and posterior-probability support. Identifying juveniles using morphology alone is difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Therefore, our approach will be useful to researchers interested in the relationship between unionid mussels and their fish hosts.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Microarray classification typically possesses two striking attributes: (1) classifier design and error estimation are based on remarkably small samples and (2) cross-validation error estimation is employed in the majority of the papers. Thus, it is necessary to have a quantifiable understanding of the behavior of cross-validation in the context of very small samples.
Results: An extensive simulation study has been performed comparing cross-validation, resubstitution and bootstrap estimation for three popular classification rules—linear discriminant analysis, 3-nearest-neighbor and decision trees (CART)—using both synthetic and real breast-cancer patient data. Comparison is via the distribution of differences between the estimated and true errors. Various statistics for the deviation distribution have been computed: mean (for estimator bias), variance (for estimator precision), root-mean square error (for composition of bias and variance) and quartile ranges, including outlier behavior. In general, while cross-validation error estimation is much less biased than resubstitution, it displays excessive variance, which makes individual estimates unreliable for small samples. Bootstrap methods provide improved performance relative to variance, but at a high computational cost and often with increased bias (albeit, much less than with resubstitution).

  Abstract                 = {Larval molluscs commonly use ciliated vela to swim and feed. In this study we used immunohistochemistry to demonstrate innervation of velar cilia and muscles by monoaminergic and peptidergic fibres in the caenogastropod, Ilyanassa obsoleta. Photoelectric recordings from pre-oral cilia on isolated pieces of velum revealed that serotonin increased, whereas catecholamines (dopamine and norepinephrine) decreased beat frequency at concentrations of 10-6 to 10-9 mol l-1. Catecholamines also increased the frequency of momentary, isolated arrests of pre-oral cilia, but failed to suppress beating of the post-oral cilia at these concentrations. The neuropeptides, FMRFamide and Leu-enkephalin, did not affect the frequency of ciliary beating or of isolated ciliary arrests, but did induce numerous muscular contractions, which were accompanied by sustained ciliary arrests. In terms of whole animal behaviour, serotonin caused larvae to concentrate toward the top of a water column and to increase feeding, whereas catecholamines caused larvae to concentrate toward the bottom of a water column and decrease feeding. Monoamine analogues which facilitated or opposed the effects of synthetic transmitters on larval behaviour, further suggested that these transmitters are released endogenously to control velar function. Finally, applications of peptides to whole larvae caused increased frequency of locomotory arrests. Together these findings demonstrate several potential roles for the nervous system in controlling larval behaviour in gastropods.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of starvation on various factors related to immunological defence in Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata) were tested in controlled laboratory experiments. A range of parameters was assessed, including total haemocyte counts, and phenoloxidase (PO), superoxide, acid phosphatase and peroxidase activities. Condition indices were also monitored as an indicator of oyster fitness. We found that the frequency of haemocytes and phenoloxidase activity decreased by 25% and 14% respectively when oysters were fed half-satiation rations for three weeks. These decreases became statistically significant when oysters were starved for three weeks. Superoxide and peroxidase activities also decreased significantly when oysters were starved for two to four weeks, while phenoloxidase and acid phosphatase activities were significantly inhibited after oysters had been starved for at least three weeks. All of the immunological parameters returned to at least their original levels after starved oysters were fed to satiation for six days. Phenoloxidase activities over-compensated during the recovery response, so that levels post-recovery were substantially higher than those evident before starvation. There were no significant changes in condition indices during any of the starvation treatments. These data indicate that starvation compromises immunological activity, and that the duration and intensity of starvation differentially affect immune responses.},

  Abstract                 = {Lysozymes (EC 3.2.1.17) are hydrolytic enzymes, characterized by their ability to cleave the ?-(1,4)-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine in peptidoglycan, the major bacterial cell wall polymer. In the animal kingdom, three major distinct lysozyme types have been identified — the c-type (chicken or conventional type), the g-type (goose-type) and the i-type (invertebrate type) lysozyme. Examination of the phylogenetic distribution of these lysozymes reveals that c-type lysozymes are predominantly present in the phylum of the Chordata and in different classes of the Arthropoda. Moreover, g-type lysozymes (or at least their corresponding genes) are found in members of the Chordata, as well as in some bivalve mollusks belonging to the invertebrates. In general, the latter animals are known to produce i-type lysozymes. Although the homology in primary structure for representatives of these three lysozyme types is limited, their three-dimensional structures show striking similarities. Nevertheless, some variation exists in their catalytic mechanisms and the genomic organization of their genes. Regarding their biological role, the widely recognized function of lysozymes is their contribution to antibacterial defence but, additionally, some lysozymes (belonging to different types) are known to function as digestive enzymes.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In bivalve molluscs, cell-mediated immunity is carried out by circulating hemocytes, resembling the monocyte/macrophage lineage of vertebrates, that can kill the microbes through phagocytosis and various cytotoxic reactions. Previous data demonstrated that activation of MAPKs (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases) is involved in the response of mussel hemocytes (\textit{Mytilus galloprovincialis} Lam.) to bacterial challenge. In this work, the possibility that modulation of components of tyrosine kinase-mediated cell signalling may participate in the activation of mussel hemocytes was investigated. Cell pre-treatment with the macrophage activator IFN? significantly increased the bactericidal activity of mussel hemocytes towards E. coli. Human recombinant IFN? stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of different members of STAT-like proteins (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription), as evaluated by Western blotting of hemocyte protein extracts with specific anti-phospho-STAT antibodies. A similar increase in phosphorylation of immunoreactive STATs was observed in hemocytes incubated with E. coli, this indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-like members represents a physiological step in hemocyte activation. IFN? lead to persistent phosphorylation of immunoreactive STAT1, a transcription factor that plays a critical role in innate immunity towards Gram negative bacteria in mammalian systems; moreover, hemocyte pretreatment with IFN? significantly increased bacteria-induced STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas IFN? did not. IFN? also transiently affected the phosphorylation state of different MAPKs. The extent and time course of MAPK phosphorylation induced by IFN? were distinct from those elicited by either IFN? or bacterial challenge. Overall, the results indicate that the hemocyte function can be modulated by heterologous cytokines and bacterial signals that act in concert through tyrosine kinase-mediated transduction pathways converging on STAT- and MAPK-like members.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the continuous development and production of manufactured nanomaterials or nanoparticles (NPs), their uptake and effects in the aquatic biota represent a major concern. Estuarine and coastal environments are expected to represent the ultimate sink for NPs, where their chemical behavior (aggregation/agglomeration) and consequent fate may be critical in determining the biological impact.
Bivalve mollusks are abundant from freshwater to marine ecosystems, where they are widely utilized in biomonitoring of environmental perturbations. As suspension-feeders, they have highly developed processes for cellular internalization of nano- and micro-scale particles (endo- and phagocytosis), integral to key physiological functions such as intra-cellular digestion and cellular immunity.
Here we will summarise available information on the effects of different types of NPs in different bivalve species, in particular \textit{Mytilus} spp. Data on the effects and modes of action of different NPs on mussel hemocytes \textit{in vitro} demonstrate that cell-mediated immunity represents a significant target for NPs. Moreover, \textit{in vivo} exposure to NPs indicates that, due to the physiological mechanisms involved in the feeding process, NP agglomerates/aggregates taken up by the gills are directed to the digestive gland, where intra-cellular uptake of nanosized materials induces lysosomal perturbations and oxidative stress. Overall, bivalves represent a particularly suitable model for investigating the effects and mechanisms of action underlying the potential toxicity of NPs in marine invertebrates},

  Abstract                 = {Development of the Crassostrea gigas gill was studied in order to better understand the feeding biology of early life stages, identify potentially critical developmental stages which may influence rearing success or recruitment to wild populations, and shed light on the evolution of the basic bivalve gill types. Larvae and juveniles were reared in an experimental hatchery, and larger specimens were obtained from a commercial hatchery. Specimens were relaxed, fixed, dried, and observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The right and left gills developed symmetrically, via a “cavitation–extension” process from the gill buds. The inner demibranchs developed first (V-stage, 0.29–2.70 mm), in a sequential postero-anterior series of homorhabdic filaments. The outer demibranchs developed later (W-stage, from 2.70 mm), also as homorhabdic filaments, synchronously along the gill axis. The principal filaments (PF) developed from the progressive fusion of three ordinary filaments (OF), at a size of 7.50 mm, and the consequent plication was accentuated by the formation of extensive tissue junctions. Effective filament number (number of descending and ascending filaments) showed a marked discontinuity at the transition from the V- to the W- stage of the gill. Filament ciliation showed several important changes: establishment of OF ciliation in the homorhabdic condition (2.70 mm), ciliary de-differentiation of the PF in the heterorhabdic condition (7.50 mm), and establishment of a latero-frontal cirri length gradient from the plical crest to the PF base. Reversal of direction of ciliary beat is also necessary prior to adult functioning of the PF. Three major transitions were identified in C. gigas gill development, each potentially important in rearing success or wild population recruitment: (1) transition from velum to gill at settlement, (2) transition from a V- to a W-shaped gill (2.70 mm), and (3) transition from the homorhabdic to the heterorhabdic condition (7.50 mm). Complete gill development was much more prolonged than in species previously studied. The major ontogenetic differences between the C. gigas heterorhabdic pseudolamellibranch gill and the pectinid heterorhabdic filibranch gill suggest that the heterorhabdic condition evolved independently in these two bivalve families.},

  Abstract                 = {Study of gill development in bivalve larvae and postlarvae provides information on the evolution of this organ and feeding mechanisms of early stages. Scanning electron microscopy was used to document the development of the filibranch homorhabdic gill in hatchery-reared larval, postlarval, and juvenile Mytilus edulis. Four key stages were identified during gill development: (1) transfer of the particle collection function from velum to gill at metamorphosis, with subsequent elongation of the gill filaments to form a gill basket, with complete frontal ciliation; (2) reflection of the inner demibranchs, and transition to a V-shaped gill; (3) delayed development of the outer demibranchs, occuring simultaneously along the gill axis, with transition to the adult final W-shape; and (4) formation of the ventral particle grooves and concomitant acquisition of dense abfrontal ciliation. These key stages signal shifts in the mechanisms of particle processing during the early development of M. edulis. Gill development in the homorhabdic filibranch M. edulis was similar to that of the early homorhabdic stages of the heterorhabdic filibranchs studied to date (Pectinidae), but different from that of the pseudolamellibranchs (Ostreidae), suggesting divergent evolution of this character. Similarly, the systems responsible for gill cohesion and structural integrity are common to both the homorhabdic and heterorhabdic filibranchs, suggesting evolutionary proximity, but they are patently different from those of the eulamellibranchs and pseudolamellibranchs, suggesting evolutionary divergence.},

  Abstract                 = {Invertebrate communities are central to many environmental monitoring programs. In freshwater ecosystems, aquatic macroinvertebrates are collected, identified and then used to infer ecosystem condition. Yet the key step of species identification is often not taken, as it requires a high level of taxonomic expertise, which is lacking in most organizations, or species cannot be identified as they are morphologically cryptic or represent little known groups. Identifying species using {DNA }sequences can overcome many of these issues; with the power of next generation sequencing (NGS), using {DNA }sequences for routine monitoring becomes feasible. Results
In this study, we test if NGS can be used to identify species from field-collected samples in an important bioindicator group, the Chironomidae. We show that Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and Cytochrome B (CytB) sequences provide accurate {DNA }barcodes for chironomid species. We then develop a NGS analysis pipeline to identifying species using megablast searches of high quality sequences generated using 454 pyrosequencing against comprehensive reference libraries of Sanger-sequenced voucher specimens. We find that 454 generated COI sequences successfully identified up to 96% of species in samples, but this increased up to 99% when combined with CytB sequences. Accurate identification depends on having at least five sequences for a species; below this level species not expected in samples were detected. Incorrect incorporation of some multiplex identifiers (MID’s) used to tag samples was a likely cause, and most errors could be detected when using MID tags on forward and reverse primers. We also found a strong quantitative relationship between the number of 454 sequences and individuals showing that it may be possible to estimate the abundance of species from 454 pyrosequencing data. Conclusions
Next generation sequencing using two genes was successful for identifying chironomid species. However, when detecting species from 454 pyrosequencing data sets it was critical to include known individuals for quality control and to establish thresholds for detecting species. The NGS approach developed here can lead to routine species-level diagnostic monitoring of aquatic ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {Lateral cilia of the gill of Mytilus edulis are controlled by a reciprocal serotonergic-dopaminergic innervation from their ganglia. Other bivalves have been studied to lesser degrees and lateral cilia of most respond to serotonin and dopamine when applied directly to the gill indicating a possible neuro or endocrine mechanism. Lateral cilia in Crassostrea virginica are affected by serotonin and dopamine, but little work has been done regarding ganglionic control of their cilia. We examined the role of the cerebral and visceral ganglia in innervating the lateral ciliated cells of the gill epithelium of C. virginica. Ciliary beating rates were measured in preparations which had the ipsilateral cerebral or visceral ganglia attached. Superfusion of the cerebral or visceral ganglia with serotonin increased ciliary beating rates which was antagonized by pretreating with methysergide. Superfusion with dopamine decreased beating rates and was antagonized by ergonovine. This study demonstrates there is a reciprocal serotonergic-dopaminergic innervation of the lateral ciliated cells, similar to that of M. edulis, originating in the cerebral and visceral ganglia of the animal and this preparation is a useful model to study regulatory mechanisms of ciliary activity as well as the pharmacology of drugs affecting biogenic amines in nervous systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve the numerical optimisation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often based on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold cross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a non-negligible variance introduces the potential for over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds.},

Increasing read length is viewed as a crucial condition to further improve transcriptome assembly, but it is unknown whether the read length really matters. In addition, though many assembly tools are available now, it is unclear whether the existing assemblers perform well enough for all data with different transcriptome complexities. In this paper, we studied these two open problems using two high-performing assemblers, Velvet/Oases and Trinity, on several simulated datasets of human, mouse and S.cerevisiae. The results suggest that (1) the read length of paired reads does not matter once it exceeds a certain threshold, and interestingly, the threshold is distinct in different organisms; (2) the quality of <italic>de novo</italic> assembly decreases sharply with the increase of transcriptome complexity, all existing <italic>de novo</italic> assemblers tend to corrupt whenever the genes contain a large number of alternative splicing events.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Reproduction is the goal of living organisms, and environmental conditions that influence sexual development are therefore critical to understanding adaptation in natural populations. It is not surprising that so much attention has been devoted to the impacts of the physical and chemical environment on this process (Vandenberg et al.). Chemicals of concern include a variety of endocrine disruptors (EDs) including oestrogen and oestrogen mimics that directly lead to malformation of the gonad. On the molecular side, the impact that EDs have on genes directly involved in the feminization or masculinization of the gonad such as Cyp 19A (or aromatase), foxl2, Sox9, Dmrt1 and NrOb1, has received considerable attention due to their direct involvement in the regulation of oestrogen and testosterone. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Pascoal et al. (2013) examine the impact of a known endocrine disruptor (tributyltin or TBT) on the transcriptome of the dog whelk, Nucella lapillus (Fig.), in relation to the formation of imposex individuals (masculinized females). They conclude that TBT mimics the endogenous ligand of the nuclear retinoid X receptor (RXR) and/or peroxisome profilerator-activated receptor (PPAR) disrupting pathways. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Increasing utilization and human population density in the coastal zone is widely believed to place increasing stresses on the resident biota, but confirmation of this belief is somewhat lacking. While we have solid evidence that highly disturbed estuarine systems have dramatic changes in the resident biota (black and white if you will), we lack tools that distinguish the shades of grey. In part, this lack of ability to distinguish shades of grey stems from the analytical tools that have been applied to studies of estuarine systems, and perhaps more important, is the insensitivity of the biological end points that we have used to assess these impacts. In this study, we will present data on the phenotypic adjustments as measured by transcriptomic signatures of a resilient organism (oysters) to land-use practices in the surrounding watershed using advanced machine-learning algorithms. We will demonstrate that such an approach can reveal subtle and meaningful shifts in oyster gene expression in response to land use. Further, the data show that gill tissues are far more responsive and provide superior discrimination of land-use classes than hepatopancreas and that transcripts encoding proteins involved in energy production, protein synthesis and basic metabolism are more robust indicators of land use than classic biomarkers such as metallothioneins, GST and cytochrome P-450.},

In this review, we discuss how endothelial cells initiate a vessel sprout through interactions with their environment and with one another, particularly through lateral inhibition. We review the composition of the local environment, which contains an initial set of guidance cues to facilitate the proper outward migration of the sprout as it emerges from a parent vessel. The long-range guidance and sprout stability cues provided by soluble molecules, extracellular matrix components, and interactions with other cell types are also discussed. We also examine emerging evidence for mechanisms that govern sprout fusion with its target and lumen formation.},

  Abstract                 = {The scallop \textit{Chlamys farreri} is one of the most important aquaculture species in northern coastal provinces. However, the sustainable development of scallop industry is currently threatened by a notorious pathogen named as acute viral necrobiotic virus (AVNV), which often causes mass mortality of the animals. Despite that great attention has been focused on this novel pathogen, little knowledge about the host–virus interactions is available. In this study, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was employed to identify the up-regulated differentially expressed genes in the hemocytes of C. farreri challenged by AVNV. A forward subtracted c{DNA }library was finally constructed and 288 positive colonies representing differentially genes were screened to perform sequencing. A total of 275 ESTs were used for further analysis using bioinformatics tools after vector screening, among which 167 ESTs could be finally identified, with significant match (E values <1 × 10?3) to the deposited genes (proteins) in the corresponding databases. These genes could be classified into ten categories according to their Gene Ontology annotations of biological processes and molecular functions, i.e. cell defense and homeostasis (13.82%), cellular protein metabolic process (14.90), cellular metabolism (13.09%), cytoskeletal or cellular component (5.82%), transcription regulation or RNA processing (2.18%), cell division (meiosis)/apoptosis (2.18%), {DNA }metabolic process and repair (1.45%), cell adhesion/signaling (1.09%), microsatellite (0.73%), and ungrouped or unknown functions (6.88). The possible biological significance of some novel genes (mainly immune and homeostasis related genes) in the host response to AVNV were discussed. This study is the first global analysis of differentially expressed genes in hemocytes from AVNV-infected C. farreri, and in addition to increasing our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this virus-associated scallop disease, the results presented here should provide new insights into the molecular basis of host–pathogen interactions in C. farreri.},

  Abstract                 = { <p>Locusts exhibit remarkable density-dependent phenotype (phase) changes from the solitary to the gregarious, making them one of the most destructive agricultural pests. This phenotype polyphenism arises from a single genome and diverse transcriptomes in different conditions. Here we report a <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome for the migratory locust and a comprehensive, representative core gene set. We carried out assembly of 21.5 Gb Illumina reads, generated 72,977 transcripts with N50 2,275 bp and identified 11,490 locust protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics analysis with eight other sequenced insects was carried out to indentify the genomic divergence between hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects for the first time and 18 genes relevant to development was found. We further utilized the quantitative feature of {RNA-seq} to measure and compare gene expression among libraries. We first discovered how divergence in gene expression between two phases progresses as locusts develop and identified 242 transcripts as candidates for phase marker genes. Together with the detailed analysis of deep sequencing data of the 4<sup>th</sup> instar, we discovered a phase-dependent divergence of biological investment in the molecular level. Solitary locusts have higher activity in biosynthetic pathways while gregarious locusts show higher activity in environmental interaction, in which genes and pathways associated with regulation of neurotransmitter activities, such as neurotransmitter receptors, synthetase, transporters, and GPCR signaling pathways, are strongly involved. Our study, as the largest <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome to date, with optimization of sequencing and assembly strategy, can further facilitate the application of <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome. The locust transcriptome enriches genetic resources for hemimetabolous insects and our understanding of the origin of insect metamorphosis. Most importantly, we identified genes and pathways that might be involved in locust development and phase change, and may thus benefit pest management.</p> },

  Abstract                 = {The Antarctic clam, \textit{Laternula elliptica}, is an infaunal stenothermal bivalve mollusc with a circumpolar distribution. It plays a significant role in bentho-pelagic coupling and hence has been proposed as a sentinel species for climate change monitoring. Previous studies have shown that this mollusc displays a high level of plasticity with regard to shell deposition and damage repair against a background of genetic homogeneity. The Southern Ocean has amongst the lowest present-day CaCO3 saturation rate of any ocean region, and is predicted to be among the first to become undersaturated under current ocean acidification scenarios. Hence, this species presents as an ideal candidate for studies into the processes of calcium regulation and shell deposition in our changing ocean environments. Results
454 sequencing of L. elliptica mantle tissue generated 18,290 contigs with an average size of 535 bp (ranging between 142 bp-5.591 kb). BLAST sequence similarity searching assigned putative function to 17% of the data set, with a significant proportion of these transcripts being involved in binding and potentially of a secretory nature, as defined by GO molecular function and biological process classifications. These results indicated that the mantle is a transcriptionally active tissue which is actively proliferating. All transcripts were screened against an in-house database of genes shown to be involved in extracellular matrix formation and calcium homeostasis in metazoans. Putative identifications were made for a number of classical shell deposition genes, such as tyrosinase, carbonic anhydrase and metalloprotease 1, along with novel members of the family 2 G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). A membrane transport protein (SEC61) was also characterised and this demonstrated the utility of the clam sequence data as a resource for examining cold adapted amino acid substitutions. The sequence data contained 46,235 microsatellites and 13,084 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs/INDELS), providing a resource for population and also gene function studies. Conclusions
This is the first 454 data from an Antarctic marine invertebrate. Sequencing of mantle tissue from this non-model species has considerably increased resources for the investigation of the processes of shell deposition and repair in molluscs in a changing environment. A number of promising candidate genes were identified for functional analyses, which will be the subject of further investigation in this species and also used in model-hopping experiments in more tractable and economically important model aquaculture species, such as Crassostrea gigas and \textit{Mytilus edulis}.},

  Abstract                 = {The striped venus Chamelea gallina clam fishery is among the oldest and the largest in the Mediterranean Sea, particularly in the inshore waters of northern Adriatic Sea. The high fishing pressure has lead to a strong stock abundance decline, enhanced by several irregular mortality events. The nearly complete lack of molecular characterization limits the available genetic resources for C. gallina. We achieved the first transcriptome of this species with the aim of identifying an informative set of expressed genes, potential markers to assess genetic structure of natural populations and molecular resources for pathogenic contamination detection. Methodology/Principal Findings
The 454-pyrosequencing of a normalized c{DNA }library of a pool C. gallina adult individuals yielded 298,494 raw reads. Different steps of reads assembly and filtering produced 36,422 contigs of high quality, one half of which (18,196) were annotated by similarity. A total of 111 microsatellites and 20,377 putative SNPs were identified. A panel of 13 polymorphic transcript-linked microsatellites was developed and their variability assessed in 12 individuals. Remarkably, a scan to search for contamination sequences of infectious origin indicated the presence of several Vibrionales species reported to be among the most frequent clam pathogen's species. Results reported in this study were included in a dedicated database available at http://compgen.bio.unipd.it/chameleabase. Conclusions/Significance
This study represents the first attempt to sequence and de novo annotate the transcriptome of the clam C. gallina. The availability of this transcriptome opens new perspectives in the study of biochemical and physiological role of gene products and their responses to large and small-scale environmental stress in C. gallina, with high throughput experiments such as custom microarray or targeted re-sequencing. Molecular markers, such as the already optimized EST-linked microsatellites and the discovered SNPs will be useful to estimate effects of demographic processes and to detect minute levels of population structuring.},

  Abstract                 = {We used a 2-DE proteomic approach to identify abundant proteins linked to oocyte quality in the {Pacific} oyster \textit{Crassostrea gigas}, an economically important bivalve. Oocyte quality of 14 females was estimated by recording fertilisation and early developmental success until D-larval stage under controlled conditions. Proteins that were differentially expressed between females showing high or low oocyte quality were identified by nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Twelve up-accumulated spots associated with low quality oocytes revealed 10 distinct proteins, including vitellogenin - breakdown products and metabolic enzymes. Eight up-accumulated spots from high quality oocytes revealed 6 distinct proteins, including chaperone molecules and cell-cycle control proteins. This is the first proteomic study dedicated to oocytes in C. gigas. Our results improve current knowledge about protein factors associated with oocyte quality in this species, and our understanding of the proteomic processes involved in their developmental competence. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Larvae were subjected to three different treatments: 1. 10 equivalent cells (Isochrysis galbana, Pavlova lutheri and Chaetoceros calcitrans) plus 20 equivalent cells of Tetraselmis suecica; 2. 80 equivalent cells of I. galbana and 3. starvation during eight days, and then individuals were re-fed on diet 1. The best results for growth were observed in larvae fed on diet 1. Starved larvae reached the best survival rate at day 8 (66%). However, three days after re-feeding all larvae died, suggesting that the “point of no return” was exceeded. In spite of the large size of S. marginatus eggs and the great amount of stored reserves, the larvae need to feed on microalgae to undergo metamorphosis. Non-methyle-interrupted dienoic fatty acids and their precursors 16:1n-7 and 18:1n-9 are of great importance in starved larvae. Saturated fatty acids, especially 16:0, fuel larval development. A certain degree of bioconversion of 18:2n-6 to 20:4n-6 was observed in S. marginatus larvae.}

Among biochemical biomarkers, acetylcholinesterase did not differ at the polluted site in all species, but there was a significant difference between the mussel and the clams, glutathione S-transferase showed a clear inhibition at the polluted site in all species and a significant difference between the two clams was also indicated, while catalase activities were increased only in V. verrucosa at the polluted site and not in mussel or the other clam. Immunological biomarkers responses were also pronounced at the polluted site. Lysozyme activity was species-dependent whereas respiratory burst activity measured as luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) was site and stimulus dependent, and it was evident in \textit{M. galloprovincialis} and V. verrucosa and not in C. chione. Further investigation focused on biochemical and immunological biomarkers related with the oxidative mechanisms in clams will strengthen and expand their use as bioindicators for pollution assessment.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies have suggested an involvement of catecholamines in the control of several larval behaviors, such as feeding, locomotion, and induction of settling and metamorphosis. In the present study we employed aldehyde-induced, blue-green fluorescence to indicate catecholamines in cells within representatives of two bivalve families, the Pectinidae (Placopecten magellanicus) and the Mytilidae (Mytilus edulis). Larvae were examined at different stages of development before and also shortly after settlement. The general distribution of fluorescent cells was similar in the two species. By midveliger stage, several fluorescent cells and fibers were located along the outer rim of each velar lobe, and a pair of flask-shaped cells was located lateral to the mouth. A single fiber from near the mouth projected to a region beneath the apical tuft. In the pediveliger, the cells by the mouth were joined by an additional two to four fluorescent cells. The developing foot also contained numerous such cells, some of which had processes that penetrated the epithelium on the "sole" and bore ciliated terminals. Fluorescent somata were also located around the edge of the mantle. Centrally projecting fibers appeared to terminate in the pedal and abdominal ganglia, which also contained a few fluorescent somata. After settlement, the velar lobes and resident fluorescent somata disappeared, but fluorescent cells in the foot persisted as this latter organ grew. Fluorescent cells within the developing gill were connected with the abdominal ganglia by means of fibers. Control preparations labeled with antibodies raised against serotonin indicated that the aldehyde-induced fluorescence was not due to the presence of indoleamines. The present study not only confirms previous chromatographic evidence suggesting the presence of catecholamines in the larvae of bivalve molluscs, but also identifies putative neuronal circuits that may control various larval behaviors.},

  Abstract                 = {Pond snails have long been the subject of intense scrutiny by researchers inter- ested in general principles of development and also cellular and molecular neurobiology. Recent work has exploited both these fields of study by examining the ontogeny of the nervous system in these animals. Much of this work has focussed upon the development of specific transmitter phenotypes to provide vignettes of neuronal subpopulations that can be traced from early embry- onic life through to adulthood. While such studies have generally confirmed previous explanations of gangliogenesis in gastropods, they have also indicated the presence of several neurons that appear earlier and in positions inconsistent with classical views of gastropods neurogenesis. The earliest of these cells contain FMRFamide-related peptides and have anteriorly projections that mark the future locations of ganglia and interconnecting pathways that will comprise the postem- bryonic central nervous system. These posterior, peptidergic cells, as well as certain, apical, monoaminergic neurons, disappear and apparently die near the end of embryonic life. Finally, populations of what appear to be peripheral sensory neurons begin to express catecholamines by around midway through embryonic life. Like several of the neurons expressing a variety of transmitters in the developing central ganglia, the catecholaminergic peripheral cells persist into postembryonic life. Transmitter phenotypes, cell shapes and locations, and neuritic morphologies all suggest that many of the neurons observed in early embryonic pond snails have recognizable homologues across the molluscs. Such observations have profoundly altered our views of neuro- genesis in gastropods over the last few years. They also suggest the promise for pond snails as fruitful models for studying the roles and mechanisms for pioneering fibres, cues triggering apoptosis, and contrasting origins and mechanisms employed for generating central vs. peripheral neurons within a single organism},

  Abstract                 = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an inherently dynamic structure during development. Large-scale tissue movements sweep the ECM to distant positions during early embryogenesis; furthermore, the previously assembled ECM filaments are extensively reused during later organogenesis. Thus, some organs, such as the heart, inherit previously assembled ECM filaments. This review focuses on the macro-assembly dynamics of fibronectin and fibrillin-2 in avian embryos. Both ECM proteins are ubiquitous in vertebrate embryos at the earliest stages of development. Recent studies compared the movement of these two ECM components and suggested that the ECM moves as a composite material, whereby distinct molecular components as well as spatially separated layers exhibit similar displacements. Utilizing advances in microscopy and high-resolution particle image velocimetry algorithms, two ECM filament relocation processes can be distinguished—each operating on different length scales. First, ECM filaments are moved by large-scale tissue motion, which rearranges major organ primordia within the embryo. The second type of motion, on the scale of the individual ECM filaments, is driven by local motility and protrusive activity of nearby cells. Both kinds of motion contribute substantially to the establishment of normal ECM structure, and both must be taken into account when attempting to understand ECM macro-assembly during embryonic morphogenesis. ECM filaments also fluctuate locally—likely reflecting pulsatile cell contractility in the associated tissues. Suppression of these fluctuations by temporal averaging yields a persistent movement pattern that is shared among embryos at equivalent stages of development. Recent studies comparing the motion of embryonic mesenchymal cell populations (newly ingressed mesodermal, pre-somitic, endothelial, and endocardial) all found that the gross displacement of these cells is to a large extent shared by the surrounding ECM. The result being that active motion relative to the local ECM scaffold is more random than previously appreciated. A future understanding of ECM assembly thus requires the study of the complex interactions between biochemical assembly steps, local cell action and the biomechanics of tissue motion.}

A high number of studies have reported the impact of external factors on hemocytes immune parameters such as temperature, salinity, pollutants or pathogens. However, only a few of them considered the impact of intrinsic parameters such as sex. Therefore, the present study assessed the impact of gender on hemocytes functions on two marine bivalves. Our results led to the conclusion that the gender contributes to this inter-individual variability. When studying the impact of an environmental variable, a pathogen or a pollutant, the sex of each animal should be determined and taken into account in the analysis and interpretation of immune parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {The human heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family contains at least eight homologous chaperone proteins. Endoplasmatic reticulum and mitochondria have their specific Hsp70 proteins, whereas the remaining six family members reside mainly in the cytosol and nucleus. The requirement for multiple highly homologous although different Hsp70 proteins is still far from clear, but their individual and tissue-specific expression suggests that they are assigned distinct biological tasks. This concept is supported by the fact that mice knockout for different Hsp70 genes display remarkably discrete phenotypes. Moreover, emerging data suggest that individual Hsp70 proteins can bring about non-overlapping and chaperone-independent functions essential for growth and survival of cancer cells. This review summarizes our present knowledge of the individual members of human Hsp70 family and elaborate on the functional differences between the cytosolic/nuclear representatives.},

  Abstract                 = {The cultivated {Pacific} oyster \textit{Crassostrea gigas} has suffered for decades large scale summer mortality phenomenon resulting from the interaction between the environment parameters, the oyster physiological and/or genetic status and the presence of pathogenic microorganisms including Vibrio species. To obtain a general picture of the molecular mechanisms implicated in C. gigas immune responsiveness to circumvent Vibrio infections, we have developed the first deep sequencing study of the transcriptome of hemocytes, the immunocompetent cells. Using Digital Gene Expression (DGE), we generated a transcript catalog of up-regulated genes from oysters surviving infection with virulent Vibrio strains (\textit{Vibrio splendidus} LGP32 and V. aestuarianus LPi 02/41) compared to an avirulent one, V. tasmaniensis LMG 20012T. For that an original experimental infection protocol was developed in which only animals that were able to survive infections were considered for the DGE approach. We report the identification of cellular and immune functions that characterize the oyster capability to survive pathogenic Vibrio infections. Functional annotations highlight genes related to signal transduction of immune response, cell adhesion and communication as well as cellular processes and defence mechanisms of phagocytosis, actin cytosqueleton reorganization, cell trafficking and autophagy, but also antioxidant and anti-apoptotic reactions. In addition, quantitative PCR analysis reveals the first identification of pathogen-specific signatures in oyster gene regulation, which opens the way for in depth molecular studies of oyster-pathogen interaction and pathogenesis. This work is a prerequisite for the identification of those physiological traits controlling oyster capacity to survive a Vibrio infection and, subsequently, for a better understanding of the phenomenon of summer mortality.},

While no exploitable structural elements were obtained for the former three, a partial amino acid sequence (X-P-P-X-X-I-V) was obtained for the latter, named Cg-636. Due to both its low MM and the presence of exotic amino acid residue (X), we suspected a bacterial origin and tracked cultivable hemolymph-resident bacteria of oyster for their antimicrobial abilities. Supernatants of 224 hemolymph resident bacteria coming from 60 oysters were screened against 10 target bacteria including aquaculture pathogens. Around 2% (5 strains) revealed antimicrobial activities. They belong to Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio genera. Two closely related strains named hCg-6 and hCg-42 have been shown to produce Bacteriocin-Like Inhibitory Substances (BLIS) even in oyster hemolymph. We report herein first BLIS-producing bacteria isolated from bivalve hemolymph. These results strongly suggest that hemolymph resident bacteria may prevent pathogen establishment and pave the way for considering a role of resident bacteria into bivalve defense.},

  Abstract                 = {Research using the {Pacific} oyster Crassostrea gigas as a model organism has experienced rapid growth in recent years due to the development of high-throughput molecular technologies. As many as 56,268 EST sequences have been sequenced to date, representing a genome-wide resource that can be used for transcriptomic investigations. Results
In this paper, we developed a {Pacific} oyster microarray containing oligonucleotides representing 31,918 transcribed sequences selected from the publicly accessible GigasDatabase. This newly designed microarray was used to study the transcriptome of male and female gonads, mantle, gills, posterior adductor muscle, visceral ganglia, hemocytes, labial palps and digestive gland. Statistical analyses identified genes differentially expressed among tissues and clusters of tissue-enriched genes. These genes reflect major tissue-specific functions at the molecular level, such as tissue formation in the mantle, filtering in the gills and labial palps, and reproduction in the gonads. Hierarchical clustering predicted the involvement of unannotated genes in specific functional pathways such as the insulin/NPY pathway, an important pathway under study in our model species. Microarray data also accurately identified reference genes whose mRNA level appeared stable across all the analyzed tissues. Adp-ribosylation factor 1 (arf1) appeared to be the most robust reference for normalizing gene expression data across different tissues and is therefore proposed as a relevant reference gene for further gene expression analysis in the {Pacific} oyster. Conclusions
This study provides a new transcriptomic tool for studies of oyster biology, which will help in the annotation of its genome and which identifies candidate reference genes for gene expression analysis.},

With the aim of analyzing transcriptional responses in the mussel \textit{Mytilus edulis} exposed to the corrosive and putatively carcinogenic hydrocarbon styrene (3–5 ppm, 3 days), a forward subtracted (SSH) c{DNA }library was produced. Female mussels were selected and digestive gland mRNA was isolated. A library with 1440 clones was produced and a total of 287 clones were sequenced, 53% being identified through BlastN analysis against Mytibase and DeepSeaVent databases. Those genes included GO terms such as ‘response to drugs’, ‘immune defense’ and ‘cell proliferation’. Furthermore, sequences related to chitin and beta-1-3-glucan metabolism were also up-regulated by styrene. Many of the obtained sequences could not be annotated constituting new mussel sequences. In conclusion, this SSH study reveals novel sequences useful to generate molecular biomarkers of styrene exposure in mussels.},

Widely used methods typically rank genes according to their differential expressions among phenotypes and pick the top-ranked genes. We observe that feature sets so obtained have certain redundancy and study methods to minimize it. We propose a minimum redundancy — maximum relevance (MRMR) feature selection framework. Genes selected via MRMR provide a more balanced coverage of the space and capture broader characteristics of phenotypes. They lead to significantly improved class predictions in extensive experiments on 6 gene expression data sets: NCI, Lymphoma, Lung, Child Leukemia, Leukemia, and Colon. Improvements are observed consistently among 4 classification methods: Naïve Bayes, Linear discriminant analysis, Logistic regression, and Support vector machines.},

  Abstract                 = {Many bivalves have an unusual mechanism of mitochondrial {DNA }(mtDNA) inheritance called doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) in which distinctly different genomes are inherited through the female (F genome) and male (M genome) lineages. In fertilized eggs that will develop into male embryos, the sperm mitochondria remain in an aggregation, which is believed to be delivered to the primordial germ cells and passed to the next generation through the sperm. In fertilized eggs that will develop into female embryos, the sperm mitochondria are dispersed throughout the developing embryo and make little if any contribution to the next generation. The frequency of embryos with the aggregated or dispersed mitochondrial type varies among females. Previous models of DUI have predicted that maternal nuclear factors cause molecular differences between unfertilised eggs from females producing embryos with predominantly dispersed or aggregated mitochondria. We test this hypothesis using females of each of the two types from a natural population. We have found small, yet detectable, differences of the predicted type at the proteome level. We also provide evidence that eggs of females giving the dispersed pattern have consistently lower expression for different proteasome subunits than eggs of females giving the aggregated pattern. These results, combined with those of an earlier study in which we used hatchery lines of \textit{Mytilus}, and with a transcriptomic study in a clam that has the DUI system of mt{DNA }transmission, reinforce the hypothesis that the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a key role in the mechanism of DUI and sex determination in bivalves. We also report that eggs of females giving the dispersed pattern have higher expression for arginine kinase and enolase, enzymes involved in energy production, whereas ferritin which is involved in iron homeostasis has lower expression. We discuss these results in the context of genetic models for DUI and suggest experimental methods for further understanding the role of these proteins in DUI.},

  Abstract                 = {Hatchery-reared larvae of the {Pacific} oyster (\textit{Crassostrea gigas}) often suffer from massive mortality induced by Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) infection, indicating the importance of better understanding of oyster immune defense systems. The accuracy of measurements of gene expression levels based on quantitative real-time PCR assays relies on the use of housekeeping genes as internal controls; however, few studies have focused on the selection of such internal controls. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of internal control genes during oyster development in virus-infected and uninfected samples. Transcriptome data for 38 developmental stages were downloaded and the gene expression patterns were classified into 30 clusters. A total of 317 orthologs of classical housekeeping genes in the oyster genome were annotated. After combining the expression profiles and oyster housekeeping gene dataset, 14 candidate internal controls were selected for further investigation: Elongation factor-1? (EF-1?), 18S rRNA (18S), 28S rRNA (28S), Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ?-actin (ACT), Ribosomal protein L7 (RL7), Ribosomal protein L27 (RL27), Ribosomal protein L36 (RL36), Ribosomal protein S18 (RS18), Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (RO21), Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (EF2), Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2D2 (UBCD1), S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1) and Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q (HNRPQ). RNA was extracted from oyster larvae infected with OsHV-1 (group A; GA), and OsHV-1 free larvae (group B; GB). The expression levels of the 14 candidate internal controls were studied in GA and GB larvae by real-time PCR. Their expression stabilities were further analyzed using the GeNorm program. RL7 and RS18 were the most stable genes in both OsHV-1 infected (GA) and uninfected (GB) larvae. These results suggest that RL7 and RS18 could be used as internal controls for studying gene expression in normal growing oyster larvae and in OsHV-1 infected larvae. These high quality internal controls will be a valuable resource in future studies of oyster larval mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {Components of the extracellular matrix may modulate the growth factor effects that play important roles in the proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells. We developed an in vitro cultivation protocol for cells of the larval marine bivalve Mytilus trossulus to study the role that extracellular matrix components may play in myodifferentiation and replication-mediated {DNA }synthesis using immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Here, we demonstrate that the extracellular matrix regulates the expression of muscle proteins, leading to their assembly and the terminal muscle differentiation of larval cells during cultivation. We further show that the myogenesis process progresses in cells cultivated on fibronectin, carbon or poly-l-lysine but is inhibited in cells grown on a collagen carpet. Consistent with a decrease in muscle protein expression in cells cultivated on collagen, we demonstrate an increase in the number of BrdU-positive cells in comparison with cells cultured on other substrates during the entire cultivation period. Moreover, we demonstrate that the matrix-dependent myogenic differentiation of larval mussel cells is reversible. Round-shaped cells cultivated on collagen were able to differentiate into muscle cells after reseeding on fibronectin, carbon or poly-l-lysine. In addition, cells cultured on collagen and then transplanted to fibronectin exhibited distinct cross-striation and contractile activity. Taken together, our data suggest that the extracellular matrix participates in the regulation of the proliferation and myodifferentiation of mussel trochophore progenitor cells and validate novel approaches for successfully culturing cells from bivalves over extended periods. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  Abstract                 = {In the present study we examined muscle development throughout the complete larval cycle of the bivalve mollusc, Mytilus trossulus. An immunofluorescence technique and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used in order to study the organization of the muscle proteins (myosin, paramyosin, twitchin, and actin) and some neurotransmitters. The appearance of the muscle bundles lagged behind their nervous supply: the neuronal elements developed slightly earlier (by 2 h) than the muscle cells. The pioneer muscle cells forming a prototroch muscle ring were observed in a completed trochophore. We documented a well-organized muscle system that consisted of the muscle ring transforming into three pairs of velar striated retractors in the early veliger. The striations were positive for all muscle proteins tested. Distribution of FMRFamide and serotonin (5-HT) immunocytochemical staining relative to the muscle ring differed significantly: 5-HT-immunioreactive cells were situated in the center of the striated muscle ring, while Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 neuropeptide FMRFamid immunoreactive fibers were located in a distal part of this ring. Our data showed clearly that the muscle proteins and the neurotransmitters were co-expressed in a coordinated fashion in a continuum during the early stages of the mussel development. Our study provides the first strong evidence that mussel larval metamorphosis is accompanied by a massive reorganization of striated muscles, followed by the development of smooth muscles capable of catch-contraction.},

This process, termed angiogenesis, involves complex and highly dynamic interactions between endothelial cells and their environment. Pro-angiogenic signals, such as VEGF, promote endothelial motility, filopodia extension and proliferation, and, together with Notch signaling, controls whether specific endothelial cells become lead tip cells or trailing stalk cells. Sprouts then convert into endothelial tubules and form connections with other vessels, which requires the local suppression of motility and the formation of new cell–cell junctions. We here review the dynamics of angiogenesis in the context of key molecules and pathways controlling tip cell selection, sprouting and the formation of new vessels.},

In an era when virtually any study organism can ‘go genomic’, it is worthwhile to review how this may impact molecular ecology. The first studies to put the next generation sequencing (NGS) to the test in ecologically well-characterized species without previous genome information were published in 2007 and the beginning of 2008. Since then several studies have followed in their footsteps, and a large number are undoubtedly under way. This review focuses on how NGS has been, and can be, applied to ecological, population genetic and conservation genetic studies of non-model species, in which there is no (or very limited) genomic resources. Our aim is to draw attention to the various possibilities that are opening up using the new technologies, but we also highlight some of the pitfalls and drawbacks with these methods.

  Abstract                 = {Despite advances in the study of particle selection in suspension-feeding bivalves, the mechanisms upon which bivalves rely to discriminate among particles have not been elucidated. We hypothesized that particle sorting in suspension-feeding bivalves could be based, in part, on a biochemical recognition mechanism mediated by lectins within the mucus that covers the feeding organs. Using \textit{Crassostrea virginica}, the Eastern oyster, our investigations demonstrated that lectins from oyster mucus can specifically bind several microalgal species as well as different types of red blood cells (RBC), triggering their agglutination. Agglutination of microalgal species and RBC varied with the source of mucus (gills vs. labial palps). Hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition assays emphasized that mucus contains several lectins. In feeding experiments, Nitzschia closterium and Tetraselmis maculata were separately incubated with mucus before being fed to oysters. Results showed that pre-treating these microalgae with mucus significantly alters the ability of oysters to sort particles. In another experiment, oysters were fed a mixture of microspheres coated with either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or glucosamide-BSA. Results show that oysters preferentially ingest microspheres with bound carbohydrates, highlighting probable interactions between lectins and carbohydrates in the mechanisms of microalgae recognition. This study confirms the presence of lectins in mucus that covers the feeding organs of oysters and suggests a new concept with regard to particle processing by suspension-feeding bivalves: specific interactions between carbohydrates on the surface of particles and lectins within the mucus mediate the selection and rejection processes.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: Perkinsus marinus is an important protistan parasite of the eastern oyster \textit{Crassostrea virginica}. Recent findings showed that oyster pallial organs (mantle, gills) are a major portal of entry for the parasite. Therefore, mucus covering these organs represents the first host effectors encountered by P. marinus. This study consisted of several experiments designed to investigate the effect of oyster pallial mucus on the growth, protease production and infectivity of P. marinus. In each experiment, P. marinus performance in cultures supplemented with pallial mucus (mantle, gill, or both) was compared to that of parasite cells grown in unsupplemented media or in cultures supplemented with oyster plasma or digestive extracts. P. marinus grown in media supplemented with C. virginica mantle mucus showed a significantly higher growth rate than cultures enriched with the other supplemental extracts, while cultures grown in gill mucus promoted higher protease production. Conversely, P. marinus grown in cultures supplemented with pallial mucus of the non-compatible host Crassostrea gigas ({Pacific} oyster) were dramatically inhibited. Challenge experiments showed a significant increase in P. marinus virulence in cultures supplemented with C. virginica pallial mucus as compared to unsupplemented cultures or to those supplemented with digestive extract or plasma. These results suggest that C. virginica mucus plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of P. marinus by enhancing the proliferation and the infectivity of this devastating parasite. The contrasting results obtained with both oyster species indicate that P. marinus host specificity may begin in the mucus.},

The two apextrin-like proteins did not present any conserved domain. The Macp protein contained the membrane/attack complex domain and its signature motif. Gene expression during larval development was analyzed by RT-PCR. There was a stage-specific up-regulation of the three proteins, suggesting that they play a role in development. Apextrin-like proteins were highly expressed at blastula and trochophore stage, whereas Macp was expressed at veliger stage. RT-PCR revealed up-regulation of the three genes in tissues and hemocytes from adults treated with bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, suggesting that they may be involved in the immune response.},

  Abstract                 = {Bivalves play vital roles in marine, brackish, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. In recent years, these ecosystems have become affected through anthropogenic activities. The ecological success of marine bivalves is based on the ability to modify their physiological functions in response to environmental changes. One of the most important mechanisms involved in adaptive responses to environmental and biological stresses is apoptosis, which has been scarcely studied in mollusks, although the final consequence of this process, {DNA }fragmentation, has been frequently used for pollution monitoring. Environmental stressors induce apoptosis in molluscan cells via an intrinsic pathway. Many of the proteins involved in vertebrate apoptosis have been recognized in model invertebrates; however, this process might not be universally conserved. \textit{Mytilus galloprovincialis} is presented here as a new model to study the linkage between molecular mechanisms that mediate apoptosis and marine bivalve ecological adaptations. Therefore, it is strictly necessary to identify the key elements involved in bivalve apoptosis. In the present study, six mitochondrial apoptotic-related genes were characterized, and their gene expression profiles following UV irradiation were evaluated. This is the first step for the development of potential biomarkers to assess the biological responses of marine organisms to stress. The results confirmed that apoptosis and, more specifically, the expression of the genes involved in this process can be used to assess the biological responses of marine organisms to stress.},

  Abstract                 = {The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent signaling accounts for the control of cellular cascades involved in many physiological functions, and a wealth of information is available on the cAMP system that operates in mammalian cells. Nevertheless, cAMP has a central role also in nonmammalian vertebrates and invertebrates. The present review aims at examining the information available on bivalve molluscs, from the first studies carried out in the early 1980s to the last progresses made in the present days. The major focus is on the structural and operational characteristics of the main actors of the signaling pathway, i.e., adenylyl cyclase, G proteins, and protein kinase A, and on the role played by the cyclic nucleotide on smooth muscle, heart, gills, gonads, and metabolism regulation. Moreover, recent evidence regarding the cAMP system as a target of environmental stress factors are discussed. It will become clear that cAMP does play a wide and important role in bivalve physiology. Several issues have been sufficiently clarified, although investigated only in a few model species. However, further fundamental aspects remain unknown, mainly regarding molecular features and interactions with other signaling pathways, thus requiring further elucidation. J. Exp.

The complex [B-L3-{23S} {RNA]} was photooxidized in the presence of rose bengal and the modified protein incorporated by reconstitution into {50S} ribosomal subunits containing all other unmodified components. Particles containing photooxidized B-L3 are defective in several functional assays, including (1) poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis, (2) peptidyltransferase activity, (3) ability to associate with a [{30S-poly(U)-Phe-tRNA]} complex, and (4) binding of elongation factor G and {GTP.} The rates of loss of the partial functional activities during photooxidation of B-L3 indicate that at least two independent inactivating events are occurring, a faster one, involving oxidation of one or more histidine residues, affecting peptidyltransferase and subunit association activities and a slower one affecting {EF-G} binding. Therefore the protein B-L3 has one or more histidine residues which are essential for peptidyltransferase and subunit association, and another residue which is essential for {EF-G-GTP} binding. B-L3 may be the ribosomal peptidyltransferase protein, or a part of the active site, and may contribute functional groups to the other active sites as well.},

  Abstract                 = {The Agamaki clam (Sinonovacula constricta) is an economically important shellfish in Asia. However, genomic research on this species is still in its infancy, and genomic resources are largely unavailable. The objective of this study was to generate expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a normalized liver complementary {DNA }library and to identify genes that function in immune defense. A total of 5,296 ESTs were sequenced, from which 540 contigs and 3,473 singletons were identified. BLAST homology analysis indicated that only 20.7% of these ESTs were homologues of known genes while the remaining 79.3% appeared to be novel sequences. Based on sequence similarities, 43 putative immune genes were identified that encode proteases and protease inhibitors, adhesive proteins, stress proteins, lysosomal enzymes, and signal transduction regulators. Our study thus provides both a large collection of novel transcripts and a detailed annotation of immune genes for an important bivalve species.},

  Abstract                 = {In response to thermal stress, many rocky shore organisms exhibit characteristic physiological changes associated with increased tolerance to subsequent high temperatures. Although presumably adaptive, activation of the heat-shock response requires a significant energetic investment and therefore may impose a trade-off between survival and other life-history traits. We investigated the effects of chronic heat stress and variation in food availability on the relative allocation of resources to competing demographic parameters in the California mussel, \textit{Mytilus californianus}. Our data support the idea that acclimatory responses to temperature stress can drive trade-offs among traits, as predicted by theory. Chronic heat stress invoked a cost to individuals, expressed as a reduction in shell growth or size-specific tissue mass in the field and laboratory, respectively. At the same time, prior thermal conditioning resulted in higher proportional survival after acute exposure to more extreme temperatures. Overall, mussels receiving less food exhibited poor condition and survival relative to individuals fed more, suggesting that individuals with limited access to resources are at greater risk because they are less able to mitigate potential costs of thermal stress through physiological mechanisms. Accurately forecasting the effects of climate change in rocky intertidal ecosystems will therefore require understanding not just how organisms respond to different temperature regimes, but also how variation in local resource availability modifies those responses.},

  Abstract                 = {Summer mortality of \textit{Crassostrea gigas} is the result of a complex interaction between oysters, their environment, and pathogens. A high heritability was estimated for resistance to summer mortality, which provided an opportunity to develop lines of oysters that were resistant (R) or susceptible (S) to summer mortality. Previous genome-wide expression profiling study of R and S oyster gonads highlighted reproduction and antioxidant defense as constitutive pathways that operate differentially between these two lines. Here, we show that signaling in innate immunity also operates differentially between these lines, and we hypothesize that this is at the main determinant of their difference in survival in the field. A reanalysis of our published microarray data using separate ANOVAs at each sampling date revealed a specific “immune” profile at the date preceding the mortality. In addition, we conducted additional microarray profiling of two other tissues, gills, and muscle, and both showed an overrepresentation of immune genes (46%) among those that are differentially expressed between the two lines. Eleven genes were pinpointed to be simultaneously differentially expressed between R and S lines in the three tissues. Among them, ten are related to “Immune Response.” For these genes, the kinetics of R mRNA levels between sampling dates appeared different just before the morality peak and suggests that under field conditions, R oysters had the capacity to modulate signaling in innate immunity whereas S oysters did not. This study enhances our understanding of the complex summer mortality syndrome and provides candidates of interest for further functional and genetics studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Although bivalves are among the most-studied marine organisms because of their ecological role and economic importance, very little information is available on the genome sequences of oyster species. This report documents three large-scale c{DNA }sequencing projects for the {Pacific} oyster \textit{Crassostrea gigas} initiated to provide a large number of expressed sequence tags that were subsequently compiled in a publicly accessible database. This resource allowed for the identification of a large number of transcripts and provides valuable information for ongoing investigations of tissue-specific and stimulus-dependant gene expression patterns. These data are crucial for constructing comprehensive {DNA }microarrays, identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellites in coding regions, and for identifying genes when the entire genome sequence of C. gigas becomes available. Description
In the present paper, we report the production of 40,845 high-quality ESTs that identify 29,745 unique transcribed sequences consisting of 7,940 contigs and 21,805 singletons. All of these new sequences, together with existing public sequence data, have been compiled into a publicly-available Website http://public-contigbrowser.sigenae.org:9090/Crassostrea_gigas/index.html webcite. Approximately 43% of the unique ESTs had significant matches against the SwissProt database and 27% were annotated using Gene Ontology terms. In addition, we identified a total of 208 in silico microsatellites from the ESTs, with 173 having sufficient flanking sequence for primer design. We also identified a total of 7,530 putative in silico, single-nucleotide polymorphisms using existing and newly-generated EST resources for the {Pacific} oyster. Conclusion
A publicly-available database has been populated with 29,745 unique sequences for the {Pacific} oyster \textit{Crassostrea gigas}. The database provides many tools to search cleaned and assembled ESTs. The user may input and submit several filters, such as protein or nucleotide hits, to select and download relevant elements. This database constitutes one of the most developed genomic resources accessible among Lophotrochozoans, an orphan clade of bilateral animals. These data will accelerate the development of both genomics and genetics in a commercially-important species with the highest annual, commercial production of any aquatic organism.},

Phagocytic hemocytes from different species of molluscs, and cells located in the intestine wall or in related glands of invertebrates and lower vertebrates showed immunoreactivity to antibodies to whole casein and related fragments. Several functional tests (cell migration, inhibition test, phagocytosis) using these peptides were performed on the mollusc hemocytes. Only ovine caseinoglycopeptide was able to increase the phagocytic activity of the hemocytes towards bacteria.},

Data were collected on growth, survival, total lipid content and lipid class composition of both healthy and starved larvae. Subsamples were stained specifically for lipid content with the lipid-specific stain Oil Red O. Newly formed straight hinge larvae of all three species exhibited small lipid droplets dispersed throughout the tissues. These were resorbed within 4 days of the initiation of feeding while the digestive gland filled with exogenously supplied lipid. Embryogenesis took place at the expense of 69 and 71% of parentally derived total lipid, 92.8 and 68.3% of which was composed of triacylglycerols (M. mercenaria and C. virginica, respectively). After 8 days of feeding on Isochrysis aff. galbana (clone T-ISO), total lipid had increased 2.7-fold in larvae of C. virginica grown at 25°C, 37.6-fold in larvae of M. mercenaria grown at 22°C, and 1.7-fold in larvae of O. edulis grown at 25°C. Shell growth in larvae of C. virginica grown at 30°C was initially higher than that at 25°C, but lipid was accumulated 2.5 times slower and survival of pediveliger larvae through metamorphosis was considerably reduced at this elevated temperature. The lipid class composition of healthy larvae of C. virginica and M. mercenaria was dominated by triacylglycerols and phospholipids in approximately equal proportions; however, triacylglycerols were preferentially catabolized during starvation and were responsible for greater than 80% of the total lipid loss. Color photographs of larvae stained with Oil Red O are presented that illustrate lipid levels in developing larvae in both healthy and poor condition. From these, a visual index of lipid content was developed to allow comparisons between larval survival and lipid levels. In general, high survival was always accompanied by a high lipid index but a high lipid index did not guarantee good survival. We suggest that the lipid index may be used to document visually the lipid content in individual bivalve larvae as an indicator of physiological condition and potential for successful metamorphosis.},

  Abstract                 = {The main objective of this research was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from an Expressed Sequences Tags (EST) data set generated by 454 pyrosequencing in the soft clam Mesodesma donacium. A total of 180 159 ESTs were yielded from a M. donacium c{DNA }library. De novo assembly was performed using stringent calling parameters, producing 10 178 contigs and 41 765 singletons. Here, a total of 2594 SNPs were discovered related to 613 consensus sequences, achieving a frequency of 1 SNPs per 260 bp. SNP variants showed that A/G, A/T and C/T were the most abundant among the identified polymorphisms. We validated a total of 12 SNPs loci by HRMA for annotated genes such as heat shock protein-70 and the translation elongation factor 1-alpha. The Gene Ontology analysis regarding molecular function level revealed that sequences with SNPs were mainly classified to protein and nucleotide binding, as well hydrolase activity, ion binding and oxidoreductase activity. Further, biological processes like cellular and metabolic process, biogenesis, localization and biological regulation were highly annotated. The most expressed genes were related to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, senescence-associated protein, ubiquitin and actin. Interestingly, some relevant genes related to immune response and biomineralization showed a high abundance, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-receptor-like protein, serine protease inhibitor, heat shock protein, aragonite-binding protein and ferritin. This study contributes to relevant genes associated with functional polymorphisms and gives an overview for future genetic investigations.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability of bacterial biofilms and biofilm exudates to induce mussel (Perna canaliculus) larvae to settle was investigated. Marine bacteria were isolated from marine seaweeds, seawater and mussels, and cultured in marine agar plates. Three main bacterial strains were selected, identified based on biochemical and 16 S rRNA techniques, and used for mussel settlement assays. Bacterial biofilms and biofilm exudates from Pseudoalteromonas sp. AMGP1 did not induce larval settlement in treatments, whereas biofilms and their exudates resulted in extremely high larval mortality. Thus, Pseudoalteromonas sp. AMGP1 biofilms may produce toxins deadly for P. canaliculus. Conversely, both Macrococcus sp. AMGM1 and Bacillus sp. AMGB1 significantly increased larval settlement (over 60%) compared with controls. These results suggest that settlement cues for P.canaliculus may be produced by the biofilm cells (and are present in the biofilm exudates), possibly as quorum sensing signals.},

  Abstract                 = {Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a highly conserved molecular chaperone that plays key roles in the folding, maintenance of structural integrity and regulation of a subset of cytosolic proteins. In the present study, the c{DNA }of Argopecten irradians HSP90 (designated AiHSP90) was cloned by the combination of homology cloning and rapid amplification of c{DNA }ends (RACE) approaches. The full-length c{DNA }of AiHSP90 was of 2669 bp, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 2175 bp encoding a polypeptide of 724 amino acids with predicted molecular weight of 83.08 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point of 4.81. BLAST analysis revealed that AiHSP90 shared high similarity with other known HSP90s, and the five conserved amino acid blocks defined as HSP90 protein family signatures were also identified in AiHSP90, which indicated that AiHSP90 should be a cytosolic member of the HSP90 family. Fluorescent real-time quantitative PCR was employed to examine the expression pattern of AiHSP90 mRNA in haemocytes of scallops challenged by Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio anguillarum and Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus. In both bacterial challenged groups, the relative expression level of AiHSP90 transcript was up-regulated and reached maximal level at 9 h after injection, and then dropped progressively to the original level at about 48 h post challenge. The results indicated that AiHSP90 was potentially involved in the immune responses against bacteria challenge in scallop A. irradian.},

The transcriptome sequencing of an organism provides quick insights into the gene space, opportunity to isolate genes of interest, development of functional markers, quantitation of gene expression, and comparative genomic studies. Although becoming cheaper, transcriptome sequencing still remains an expensive endeavor. Further, the assembly of millions and billions of {RNA-seq} reads to construct the complete transcriptome poses great informatics challenges. Here, first we outline various important issues from experimental design to data analysis, including various strategies of transcriptome assembly, which need substantial consideration for a successful {RNA-seq} experiment. Further, we describe a method for using {RNA-seq} to characterize the transcriptome of a plant species, taking the example of a legume crop plant chickpea. Our aim is to provide a quick start guide to the nonexpert researchers for NGS-based transcriptome analysis.}

  Abstract                 = {Mussels are widespread in coastal environments and experience various physical, chemical, and bacteriological conditions. Owing to the increase of coastal urbanization, mussels are now commonly exposed not only to indigenous bacteria, but also to enteric bacteria originating from pulsed and chronic sewage discharges into coastal environments. Due to its broad resilience to environmental variations, the blue mussel \textit{Mytilus edulis} is commonly used as an indicator of environmental quality in bio-monitoring programs. However, since mussel immune system capabilities may be affected by the presence of exogenous fecal bacteria in coastal seawater subjected to sewage discharges, we aimed to determine the effect of \textit{in vivo} bacterial challenges on mussels' immune competency by using two exogenous enteric bacterial strains, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, and an indigenous bacterial strain \textit{Vibrio splendidus} (as control). Bacterial strains were tested individually, by injection into the posterior adductor muscle at three different cell densities (102, 103, and 104 cells). Unlike classic \textit{in vitro} experiments using higher bacterial concentrations, neither the enteric bacteria nor the indigenous strain induced significant increase or decrease of either cell-mediated (phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species, and NO x production) or humoral components (prophenoloxidase-like, acid phosphatase, and l-leucine-aminopeptidase production) of the immune system. This study demonstrates that, at low concentrations, E. coli and E. faecalis do not represent an additional threat that could impair M. edulis immune competency and, as a consequence, its potential of survival in coastal areas subjected to sewage discharges.},

Here we use SOLiD sequencing to examine gene expression patterns in {Pacific} oyster (\textit{Crassostrea gigas}) populations exposed to varying degrees of anthropogenic impact. Novel transcripts were identified and {RNA-seq} analysis revealed several hundred differentially expressed genes. Gene enrichment analysis determined that in addition to biological processes predicted to be associated with anthropogenic influences (e.g. immune response), other processes play important roles including cell recognition and cell adhesion. To evaluate the effectiveness of restricting characterization solely to short read sequences, mapping and {RNA-seq} analysis were also performed using publicly available transcriptome sequence data as a scaffold. This study demonstrates that ultra-short read sequencing technologies can effectively generate novel transcriptome information, identify differentially expressed genes, and will be important for examining environmental physiology of non-model organisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Epidemiological studies have correlated arsenic exposure in drinking water with adverse developmental outcomes such as stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, neonatal mortality, low birth weight, delays in the use of musculature, and altered locomotor activity. Killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) were used as a model to help to determine the mechanisms by which arsenic could impact development. Killifish embryos were exposed to three different sodium arsenite concentrations and were collected at 32 h post-fertilization (hpf), 42 hpf, 168 hpf, or < 24 h post-hatch. A killifish oligo microarray was developed and used to examine gene expression changes between control and 25-ppm arsenic-exposed hatchlings. With artificial neural network analysis of the transcriptomic data, accurate prediction of each group (control vs. arsenic-exposed embryos) was obtained using a small subset of only 332 genes. The genes differentially expressed include those involved in cell cycle, development, ubiquitination, and the musculature. Several of the genes involved in cell cycle regulation and muscle formation, such as fetuin B, cyclin D-binding protein 1, and CapZ, were differentially expressed in the embryos in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Examining muscle structure in the hatchlings showed that arsenic exposure during embryogenesis significantly reduces the average muscle fiber size, which is coupled with a significant 2.1- and 1.6-fold upregulation of skeletal myosin light and heavy chains, respectively. These findings collectively indicate that arsenic exposure during embryogenesis can initiate molecular changes that appear to lead to aberrant muscle formation. © The Author 2011.

  Abstract                 = {Bacterial infections are common in bivalve larvae and can lead to significant mortality, notably in hatcheries. Numerous studies have identified the pathogenic bacteria involved in such mortalities, but physiological changes associated with pathogen exposure at larval stage are still poorly understood. In the present study, we used an integrative approach including physiological, enzymatic, biochemical, and molecular analyses to investigate changes in energy metabolism, lipid remodelling, cellular stress, and immune status of Crassostrea gigas larvae subjected to experimental infection with the pathogenic bacteria Vibrio coralliilyticus. Findings
Our results showed that V. coralliilyticus exposure induced (1) limited but significant increase of larvae mortality compared with controls, (2) declined feeding activity, which resulted in energy status changes (i.e. reserve consumption, ?-oxidation, decline of metabolic rate), (3) fatty acid remodeling of polar lipids (changes in phosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylcholine composition`, non-methylene–interrupted fatty acids accumulation, lower content of major C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as activation of desaturases, phospholipase and lipoxygenase), (4) activation of antioxidant defenses (catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxin) and cytoprotective processes (heat shock protein 70, pernin), and (5) activation of the immune response (non-self recognition, NF-?? signaling pathway, haematopoiesis, eiconosoids and lysophosphatidyl acid synthesis, inhibitor of metalloproteinase and antimicrobial peptides). Conclusion
Overall, our results allowed us to propose an integrative view of changes induced by a bacterial infection in {Pacific} oyster larvae, opening new perspectives on the response of marine bivalve larvae to infections.},

To document molecular changes associated with the mortality event, mRNA levels were compared to biochemical and physiological data, previously described in a companion paper. Among the 18 genes studied, comparatively to the antibiotic control, 10 showed a lower relative gene expression when the massive mortality occurred. Six of them are presumed to be related to metabolism, corroborating the metabolic depression associated with the mortality event suggested by biochemical and physiological analyses. Relationships between the regulation of antioxidant enzyme activities, lipid peroxidation, and the mRNA abundance of genes linked to oxidative stress, cytoprotection, and immune response are also discussed. Finally, we observed an increase in the transcript abundance of two genes involved in apoptosis and cell regulation simultaneously with mortality, suggesting that these processes might be linked.},

  Abstract                 = {Males and females share the same genome, thus, phenotypic divergence requires differential gene expression and sex-specific regulation. Accordingly, the analysis of expression patterns is pivotal to the understanding of sex determination mechanisms. Many bivalves are stable gonochoric species, but the mechanism of gonad sexualization and the genes involved are still unknown. Moreover, during the period of sexual rest, a gonad is not present and sex cannot be determined. A mechanism associated with germ line differentiation in some bivalves, including the Manila clam \textit{Ruditapes philippinarum}, is the doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) of mitochondria, a variation of strict maternal inheritance. Two mitochondrial lineages are present, one transmitted through eggs and the other through sperm, as well as a mother-dependent sex bias of the progeny. We produced a de novo annotation of 17,186 transcripts from R. philippinarum and compared the transcriptomes of males and females and identified 1,575 genes with strong sex-specific expression and 166 sex-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, obtaining preliminary information about genes that could be involved in sex determination. Then we compared the transcriptomes between a family producing predominantly females and a family producing predominantly males to identify candidate genes involved in regulation of sex-specific aspects of DUI system, finding a relationship between sex bias and differential expression of several ubiquitination genes. In mammalian embryos, sperm mitochondria are degraded by ubiquitination. A modification of this mechanism is hypothesized to be responsible for the retention of sperm mitochondria in male embryos of DUI species. Ubiquitination can additionally regulate gene expression, playing a role in sex determination of several animals. These data enable us to develop a model that incorporates both the DUI literature and our new findings.},

Hidden within this simple module are family members that all can undergo various modifications resulting in expansion of functional spectrum. Three-dimensional structures representing all three components are now available. These structures have allowed us to interpret cellular observations in molecular terms and at the same time helped us to bring forward new concepts focused towards understanding the specificity in the NF-?B activation pathway.},

  Abstract                 = {The apical ganglion (AG) of larval caenogastropods, such as Ilyanassa obsoleta, houses a sensory organ, contains five serotonergic neurons, innervates the muscular and ciliary components of the velum, and sends neurites into a neuropil that lies atop the cerebral commissure. During metamorphosis, the AG is lost. This loss had been postulated to occur through some form of programmed cell death (PCD), but it is possible for cells within the AG to be respecified or to migrate into adjacent ganglia. Evidence from histological sections is supported by results from a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, which indicate that cells of the AG degenerate by PCD. PCD occurs after metamorphic induction by serotonin or by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Cellular degeneration and nuclear condensation and loss were observed within 12 h of metamorphic induction by NOS inhibition and occur before loss of the velar lobes, the ciliated tissue used for larval swimming and feeding. Velar disintegration happens more rapidly after metamorphic induction by serotonin than by 7-nitroindazole, a NOS inhibitor. Loss of the AG was complete by 72 h after induction. Spontaneous loss of the AG in older competent larvae may arise from a natural decrease in endogenous NOS activity, giving rise to the tendency of aging larvae to display spontaneous metamorphosis in culture.},

The availability of next-generation sequencing technologies has the potential to revolutionize genomic research and enable us to focus on a large number of outstanding questions that previously could not be addressed effectively. Indeed, we are now able to study genetic variation on a genome-wide scale, characterize gene regulatory processes at unprecedented resolution, and soon, we expect that individual laboratories might be able to rapidly sequence new genomes. However, at present, the analysis of next-generation sequencing data is challenging, in particular because most sequencing platforms provide short reads, which are difficult to align and assemble. In addition, only little is known about sources of variation that are associated with next-generation sequencing study designs. A better understanding of the sources of error and bias in sequencing data is essential, especially in the context of studies of variation at dynamic quantitative traits.},

  Abstract                 = {While larval bivalves are highly sensitive to ocean acidification, the basis for this sensitivity and the longer-term implications of this sensitivity are unclear. Experiments were performed to assess the short-term (days) and long-term (months) consequences of larval stage exposure to varying CO2 concentrations for calcifying bivalves. Higher CO2 concentrations depressed both calcification rates assessed using 45Ca uptake and RNA : {DNA }ratios in Mercenaria mercenaria and Argopecten irradians larvae with RNA : {DNA }ratios being highly correlated with larval growth rates (r2>0.9). These findings suggested that high CO2 has a cascading negative physiological impact on bivalve larvae stemming in part from lower calcification rates. Exposure to elevated CO2 during the first four days of larval development significantly depressed A. irradians larval survival rates, while a 10-day exposure later in larval development did not, demonstrating the extreme CO2 sensitivity of bivalve larvae during first days of development. Short- (weeks) and long-term (10 month) experiments revealed that individuals surviving exposure to high CO2 during larval development grew faster when exposed to normal CO2 as juveniles compared to individuals reared under ambient CO2 as larvae. These increased growth rates could not, however, overcome size differences established during larval development, as size deficits of individuals exposed to even moderate levels of CO2 as larvae were evident even after 10 months of growth under normal CO2 concentrations. This "legacy effect" emphasizes the central role larval stage CO2 exposure can play in shaping the success of modern-day bivalve populations.},

Here we review the biogenesis pathways of the three classes of sncRNAs, namely short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These ncRNAs have been extensively studied and are involved in pathways leading to specific gene silencing and the protection of genomes against virus and transposons, for example. Also, lncRNAs have emerged as pivotal molecules for the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression which is supported by their tissue-specific expression patterns, subcellular distribution, and developmental regulation. Therefore, we also focus our attention on their role in differentiation and development. SncRNAs and lncRNAs play critical roles in defining {DNA }methylation patterns, as well as chromatin remodeling thus having a substantial effect in epigenetics. The identification of some overlaps in their biogenesis pathways and functional roles raises the hypothesis that these molecules play concerted functions \textit{in vivo}, creating complex regulatory networks where cooperation with regulatory proteins is necessary. We also highlighted the implications of biogenesis and gene expression deregulation of sncRNAs and lncRNAs in human diseases like cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {The eastern oyster \textit{Crassostrea virginica} is an ecologically and economically important estuarine organism. Roseovarius Oyster Disease (ROD), caused by the bacterium Roseovarius crassostreae, went unreported before 1988 and presently affects oysters from the Long Island Sound north to Maine. The identification of potential genes and pathways of the effective host defense response in the eastern oyster to R. crassostreae is important not only to provide a basis for enhanced breeding techniques, but also contributes to the understanding of innate immunity in a broader, evolutionary sense. The goal of this study is to uncover genes and general processes potentially involved in disease resistance to ROD in the eastern oyster and identify diversified gene families involved in immunity. ROD-resistant and ROD-susceptible families of oysters were exposed to R. crassostreae and c{DNA }from samples collected at 1, 5, 15, and 30 days after challenge was sequenced using Illumina GAIIx. Patterns of differential gene expression were analyzed at the gene and gene family levels. We used sequence similarity clustering to define gene families and further explored the size, composition, and phylogeny of several groups of diversified proteins. The eastern oyster host defense response to R. crassostreae involved serine proteases, serine protease inhibitors, c-type lectins, C1q domain-containing proteins, fibrinogen domain-containing proteins (FREPs), interferon-induced protein 44 family proteins, scavenger receptors with class B SRCR domains, and GTPase of the immunity associated protein family (GIMAP) proteins. Further, similarity clustering of proteins and translated transcripts from diverse invertebrates suggested that GIMAP proteins are expanded in molluscs and IFI44 proteins are expanded in bivalves. We have also identified several diversified gene families of unknown identity that appear to be involved in oyster immunity against R. crassostreae. This research provides candidate genetic markers to aid in the breeding of disease-resistant strains of oysters.}

However, samples collected from human subjects in clinical trials possess a level of complexity, arising from multiple cell types, that can obfuscate the analysis of data derived from them. Failure to identify, quantify, and incorporate sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on subsequent statistical studies.
We describe an approach that builds upon a linear latent variable model, in which expression levels from mixed cell populations are modeled as the weighted average of expression from different cell types. We solve these equations using quadratic programming, which efficiently identifies the globally optimal solution while preserving non-negativity of the fraction of the cells. We applied our method to various existing platforms to estimate proportions of different pure cell or tissue types and gene expression profilings of distinct phenotypes, with a focus on complex samples collected in clinical trials.
We tested our methods on several well controlled benchmark data sets with known mixing fractions of pure cell or tissue types and mRNA expression profiling data from samples collected in a clinical trial. Accurate agreement between predicted and actual mixing fractions was observed. In addition, our method was able to predict mixing fractions for more than ten species of circulating cells and to provide accurate estimates for relatively rare cell types (<10% total population). Furthermore, accurate changes in leukocyte trafficking associated with Fingolomid (FTY720) treatment were identified that were consistent with previous results generated by both cell counts and flow cytometry. These data suggest that our method can solve one of the open questions regarding the analysis of complex transcriptional data: namely, how to identify the optimal mixing fractions in a given experiment.},

  Abstract                 = {A c{DNA }sequence with homologies to members of the LPS-binding protein and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) family was identified in the oyster Crassostrea gigas. The recombinant protein was found to bind LPS, to display bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli, and to increase the permeability of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. This indicated that it is a BPI rather than an LPS-binding protein. By in situ hybridization, the expression of the C. gigas BPI (Cg-bpi) was found to be induced in hemocytes after oyster bacterial challenge and to be constitutive in various epithelia of unchallenged oysters. Thus, Cg-bpi transcripts were detected in the epithelial cells of tissues/organs in contact with the external environment (mantle, gills, digestive tract, digestive gland diverticula, and gonad follicles). Therefore, Cg-BPI, whose expression profile and biological properties are reminiscent of mammalian BPIs, may provide a first line of defense against potential bacterial invasion. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a BPI in an invertebrate.},

Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome.},

  Abstract                 = {{DNA }microarray technology is revolutionizing many aspects of biological research, allowing the expression of many thousands of gene transcripts to be monitored simultaneously. This provides powerful tools for the genome-wide correlation of gene transcript levels with physiological responses and alterations in physiological states. To date, microarray analyses have been applied almost exclusively to a few model species for which the abundant gene sequence data permit the fabrication of whole-genome microarrays. However, many interesting physiological traits and responses are poorly expressed or absent in model species and may be better illustrated in nonmodel organisms. Comparative approaches to understanding function traditionally focus on species that by virtue of their unusual adaptations, lifestyles, and phylogeny are particularly suited to address a specific biological process or problem. In this review, we show that microarray technology can be successfully applied to these nonmodel species and used to generate new insights of comparative and evolutionary significance into animal function.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: A vital ingredient for engineering bone tissue, in the culture dish, is the use of recombinant matrix and growth proteins to help accelerate the growth of cultivated tissues into clinically acceptable quantities. The skeletal organic matrices of calcifying marine invertebrates are an untouched potential source of such growth inducing proteins. They have the advantage of being ready-made and retain the native state of the original protein. Striking evidence shows that skeleton building bone morphogenic protein-2/4 (BMP) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) exist within various marine invertebrates such as, corals. Best practice mariculture and the latest innovations in long-term marine invertebrate cell cultivation can be implemented to ensure that these proteins are produced sustainably and supplied continuously. This also guarantees that coral reef habitats are not damaged during the collection of specimens. Potential proteins for bone repair, either extracted from the skeleton or derived from cultivated tissues, can be identified, evaluated and retrieved using chromatography, cell assays and proteomic methods. Due to the current evidence for bone matrix protein analogues in marine invertebrates, together with the methods established for their production and retrieval there is a genuine prospect that they can be used to regenerate living bone for potential clinical use.},

Poly I:C injection induced an antiviral state in C. gigas as the percentage of viral-infected oysters at 48 h post infection was significantly lower in the poly I:C treatment (11%) compared to seawater controls (100%). In an additional experiment, we demonstrated that the protective role of poly I:C is reproducible and elicits a specific antiviral response as immune-priming with heat-killed \textit{Vibrio splendidus} provided no protection against subsequent viral infection. In both experiments, genes homologous to a toll-like receptor (TLR), MyD88, interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and protein kinase R (PKR) were up-regulated in oysters immune-primed with poly I:C compared to seawater controls (p < 0.05). The MyD88, IRF and PKR genes were also significantly up-regulated in response to OsHV-1 ?var infection (p < 0.05), which is suggestive that they are implicated in the antiviral response of C. gigas. Our results demonstrate that C. gigas can recognise double-strand RNA to initiate an innate immune response that inhibits viral infection. The observed response has striking similarities to the hallmarks of the type-1 interferon response of vertebrates.},

Three of them were induced in response to challenge lending support to their involvement in oyster immunity. Moreover, four other genes were highly homologous to components of the NF-?B signaling pathway which is involved in innate immune response in Drosophila and mammals.

  Abstract                 = {Increase in oxidative damage and decrease in cellular maintenance is often associated with aging, but, in marine ectotherms, both processes are also strongly influenced by somatic growth, maturation and reproduction. In this study, we used a single cohort of the short-lived catarina scallop Argopecten ventricosus, to investigate the effects of somatic growth, reproduction and aging on oxidative damage parameters (protein carbonyls, TBARS and lipofuscin) and cellular maintenance mechanisms (antioxidant activity and apoptosis) in scallops, caged in their natural environment. The concentrations of protein carbonyls and TBARS increased steeply during the early period of fast growth and during reproduction in one-year-old scallops. However, oxidative damage was transient, and apoptotic cell death played a pivotal role in eliminating damage in gill, mantle and muscle tissues of young scallops. Animals were able to reproduce again in the second year, but the reduced intensity of apoptosis impaired subsequent removal of damaged cells. In late survivors low antioxidant capacity and apoptotic activity together with a fast accumulation of the age pigment lipofuscin was observed. Rates of oxygen consumption and oxidative stress markers were strongly dependent on somatic growth and reproductive state but not on temperature. Compared to longer-lived bivalves, A. ventricosus seems more susceptible to oxidative stress with higher tissue-specific protein carbonyl levels and fast accumulation of lipofuscin in animals surviving the second spawning. Superoxide dismutase activity and apoptotic cell death intensity were however higher in this short-lived scallop than in longer-lived bivalves. The life strategy of this short-lived and intensely predated scallop supports rapid somatic growth and fitness as well as early maturation at young age at the cost of fast cellular degradation in second year scallops.},

  Abstract                 = {During development, Drosophila larvae undergo a dramatic increase in body mass wherein nutritional and developmental cues are transduced into growth through the activity of complex signaling pathways. Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases have an established role in this process. In this study we identify Drosophila phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase (dPIP4K) as a phosphoinositide kinase that regulates growth during larval development. Loss-of-function mutants in dPIP4K show reduced body weight and prolonged larval development, whereas overexpression of dPIP4K results both in an increase in body weight and shortening of larval development. The growth defect associated with dPIP4K loss of function is accompanied by a reduction in the average cell size of larval endoreplicative tissues. Our findings reveal that these phenotypes are underpinned by changes in the signaling input into the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling complex and changes in the activity of its direct downstream target p70 S6 kinase. Together, these results define dPIP4K activity as a regulator of cell growth and TOR signaling during larval development.},

  Abstract                 = {On the basis of anatomy and larval behavior, the apical sensory organ (ASO) of gastropod veliger larvae has been implicated as the site of perception of cues for settlement and metamorphosis. Until now, there have been no experimen- tal data to support this hypothesis. In this study, cells in the ASO of veliger larvae of the tropical nudibranch Phestilla sibogae were stained with the styryl vital dye DASPEI and then irradiated with a narrow excitatory light beam on a fluo- rescence microscope. When its ASO cells were bleached by irradiation for 20 min or longer, an otherwise healthy larva was no longer able to respond to the usual metamorphic cue, a soluble metabolite from a coral prey of the adult nudibranch. The irradiated cells absorbed the dye acridine orange, suggest- ing that they were dying. When larvae not stained with DAS- PEI were similarly irradiated, or when stained larvae were irradiated with the light beam focused on other parts of the body, there was no loss of ability to metamorphose. Together these data provide strong support for the hypothesis. Potassium and cesium ions, known to induce metamorphosis in larvae of many marine-invertebrate phyla, continue to induce metamor- phosis in larvae that have lost the ability to respond to the coral inducer due to staining and irradiation. These results demon- strate that (1) the ASO-ablated larvae have not lost the ability to metamorphose and (2) the ions do not act only on the metamorphic-signal receptor cells, but at other sites down- stream in the metamorphic signal transduction pathway.},

  Abstract                 = {Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is a key adaptor molecule for the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and Toll-like/interleukin-1 receptor superfamily. It plays an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. The TRAF6 of Japanese scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis (designated as MyTRAF6) was identified and characterized in this study. The full-length c{DNA }of MyTRAF6 was 2,407 bp, which consisted of 239-bp 5?-terminal untranslated region, 1,974-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 657 amino acids, 194-bp of 3?-terminal untranslated region followed by a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a poly (A) tail. The predicted amino acid sequence of MyTRAF6 contained the characteristic motifs of TRAF proteins, including a Zinc finger of RING-type, two Zinc fingers of TRAF-type, and a MATH (meprin and TRAF homology) domain. It had an overall identity of 43–96 % with those of other TRAF6s, the highest identity (96 %) with \textit{Chlamys farreri} TRAF6, and the least identity (43 %) with Meleagris gallopavo TRAF6. Phylogenetic analysis classified MyTRAF6 as a true TRAF6 ortholog. In addition, the promoter of MyTRAF6 was also identified by genome walking. It contained several potential transcription factor-binding sites and three single nucleotide polymorphisms. qRT–PCR analysis revealed that MyTRAF6 was highly expressed in hemocytes of adult M. yessoensis. MyTRAF6 transcript level in the hemocytes reached a maximum 6 h after Vibrio anguilarum challenge. The results indicated that MyTRAF6 may fulfill an important function during M. yessoensis bacterial infection. It could be a key effector molecule involved in the innate defense of molluscs.},

  Abstract                 = {Compared with understanding of biological shape and form, knowledge is sparse regarding what regulates growth and body size of a species. For example, the genetic and physiological causes of heterosis (hybrid vigor) have remained elusive for nearly a century. Here, we investigate gene-expression patterns underlying growth heterosis in the {Pacific} oyster (\textit{Crassostrea gigas}) in two partially inbred (f = 0.375) and two hybrid larval populations produced by a reciprocal cross between the two inbred families. We cloned c{DNA }and generated 4.5 M sequence tags with massively parallel signature sequencing. The sequences contain 23,274 distinct signatures that are expressed at statistically nonzero levels and show a highly positively skewed distribution with median and modal counts of 9.25 million and 3 transcripts per million, respectively. For nearly half of these signatures, expression level depends on genotype and is predominantly nonadditive (hybrids deviate from the inbred average). Statistical contrasts suggest ?350 candidate genes for growth heterosis that exhibit concordant nonadditive expression in reciprocal hybrids; this represents only ?1.5% of the >20,000 transcripts. Patterns of gene expression, which include dominance for low expression and even underdominance of expression, are more complex than predicted from classical dominant or overdominant explanations of heterosis. Preliminary identification of ribosomal proteins among candidate genes supports the suggestion from previous studies that efficiency of protein metabolism plays a role in growth heterosis.},

  Abstract                 = {The transforming growth factor ? (TGF?) superfamily includes bone morphogenetic proteins, activins and TGF-? sensu stricto (s.s.). These ligands have been shown to play a key role in numerous biological processes including early embryonic development and immune regulation. They transduce their signal through a hetromeric complex of type I and type II receptors. Such receptors have been identified in ecdysozoans but none have been found as yet in the other major protostomal clade, the lophotrochozoans. Here, we report the identification of the first lophotrochozoan TGF? s.s. type I receptor (Cg-TGF?RI) from the mollusk \textit{Crassostrea gigas}. The phylogenetic and structural analyses as well as the expression pattern during early development suggest Cg-TGF?RI to belong to the TGF? s.s./activin type I receptor clade and functional studies corroborate these deductions. The use of the zebrafish embryo as a reporter organism reveals that either Cg-TGF?RI or its dominant negative acting truncated form, when overexpressed during gastrulation, resulted in a range of phenotypes displaying severe disturbance of anterioposterior patterning due to a strong modulation of ventrolateral mesoderm patterning. Finally, a Cg-TGF?RI cytokine activity during immune regulation in C. gigas has been investigated by real-time PCR in haemocytes and mantle edge during an \textit{in vivo} bacterial LPS challenge. One piece of evidence from this study suggests that the molecular mechanisms controlling mesodermal patterning and some immune regulations across all bilateria could be conserved through a functional TGF-? s.s. pathway in lophotrochozoans.},

Intense research of more than 20 years provides evidence that the extending family of I?Bs act not simply as reversible inhibitors of NF-?B activation but rather as a complex regulatory module, which assures feedback regulation of the NF-?B system and either can inhibit or promote transcriptional activity in a stimulus-dependent manner. Thus, I?B and NF-?B/Rel family proteins establish a complex interrelationship that allows modulated NF-?B-dependent transcription, tailored to the physiological environment.},

Evidence is emerging that these chromatin-remodelling enzymes have instructive and programmatic roles during development.

  Abstract                 = {The sequence of 13.9 kilobases (kb) of the 17.1-kb mitochondrial genome of Mytilus edulis has been determined, and the arrangement of all genes has been deduced. Mytilus mitochondrial {DNA }(mtDNA) contains 37 genes, all of which are transcribed from the same {DNA }strand. The gene content of Mytilus is typically metazoan in that it includes genes for large and small ribosomal RNAs, for a complete set of transfer RNAs and for 12 proteins. The protein genes encode the cytochrome b apoenzyme, cytochrome c oxidase (CO) subunits I-III, NADH dehydrogenase (ND) subunits 1-6 and 4L, and ATP synthetase (ATPase) subunit 6. No gene for ATPase subunit 8 could be found. The reading frames for the ND1, COI, and COIII genes contain long extensions relative to those genes in other metazoan mtDNAs. There are 23 tRNA genes, one more than previously found in any metazoan mtDNA. The additional tRNA appears to specify methionine, making Mytilus mt{DNA }unique in having two tRNA(Met) genes. Five lengthy unassigned intergenic sequences are present, four of which vary in length from 79 to 119 nucleotides and the largest of which is 1.2 kb. The base compositions of these are unremarkable and do not differ significantly from that of the remainder of the mtDNA. The arrangement of genes in Mytilus mt{DNA }is remarkably unlike that found in any other known metazoan mtDNA.},

  Abstract                 = {How well does {RNA-seq} data perform for quantitative whole gene expression analysis in the absence of a genome? This is one unanswered question facing the rapidly growing number of researchers studying non-model species. Using Homo sapiens data and resources, we compared the direct mapping of sequencing reads to predicted genes from the genome with mapping to de novo transcriptomes assembled from {RNA-seq} data. Gene coverage and expression analysis was further investigated in the non-model context by using increasingly divergent genomic reference species to group assembled contigs by unique genes. Results
Eight transcriptome sets, composed of varying amounts of Illumina and 454 data, were assembled and assessed. Hybrid 454/Illumina assemblies had the highest transcriptome and individual gene coverage. Quantitative whole gene expression levels were highly similar between using a de novo hybrid assembly and the predicted genes as a scaffold, although mapping to the de novo transcriptome assembly provided data on fewer genes. Using non-target species as reference scaffolds does result in some loss of sequence and expression data, and bias and error increase with evolutionary distance. However, within a 100 million year window these effect sizes are relatively small. Conclusions
Predicted gene sets from sequenced genomes of related species can provide a powerful method for grouping {RNA-seq} reads and annotating contigs. Gene expression results can be produced that are similar to results obtained using gene models derived from a high quality genome, though biased towards conserved genes. Our results demonstrate the power and limitations of conducting {RNA-seq} in non-model species.},

The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies provides an excellent opportunity to rapidly and cost-effectively discover a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in scallops. Here we described an approach that could be potentially used to screen interspecific transferable SNPs from transcriptomic data. Following this approach, 38 polymorphic SNP markers were developed in Zhikong scallop, of which 8 were also polymorphic in Yesso scallop, resulting in a transferability rate of 21 %, which is 4.6 times higher than that from randomly selected SNP markers. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the survey of SNP transferability in scallops. SNP markers developed in this study would be useful in genetic studies as well as evolutionary studies in the two scallop species.},

The deficiency of genomic and transcriptomic data is becoming the bottleneck of further researches on its complex and unique developmental processes. To improve this situation, in this study, a large-scale RNA sequencing was conducted onM. meretrixon larval stages. In particular, mRNAs of trochophore, D-veliger, pediveliger, and postlarva were purified, reverse transcribed, and sequenced through 454 sequencing technology. A total of 704,671 reads were obtained and assembled into 124,737 unique sequences (35,205 contigs and 89,532 singletons). Further analysis showed that 118,075 (94.66%) of these sequences were low-expression-level transcripts. Fifteen thousand two hundred fifteen (12.20%) of the unique sequences were annotated by searching against Uniprot Protein Knowledgebase, while the others (109,522, 87.80%) were left as novel sequences. Gene ontology analysis of the annotated sequences showed that most of them were assigned to certain gene ontology terms. By analyzing the depth of each unique sequence, a preliminary quantification analysis was conducted. An amount of sequences that showed a dramatic transcript discrepancy among the four larval stages were screened, which were related to development, growth, shell formation, and immune responses etc. As the first attempt on large-scale RNA sequencing of marine bivalve larvae, this work would enrich the knowledge of larval development of marine bivalves and provide fundamental support for further researches},

However, the transcriptomic and genomic resources for pearl oysters are still limited. To improve this situation, transcriptome sequencing was conducted from four species of pearl oysters with Illumina HiSeq™ 2000. There were four gigabase-scale transcriptomes for four species of pearl oysters, ?26.3 million reads with ?2.37 gigabase base pairs (Gbp) in Pinctada fucata, ?26.5 million reads with ?2.39 Gbp in Pinctada margaritifera, ?27.0 million reads with ?2.43 Gbp in Pinctada maxima, and ?25.9 million reads with ?2.33 Gbp in Pteria penguin, respectively. After sequence assembly and blastx alignment, the numbers of annotated unigenes ?200 bp were 33,882 in P. fucata, 30,666 in P. margaritifera, 26,420 in P. maxima, and 29,928 in P. penguin. Based on these annotated unigenes among four species of pearl oysters, CDSs were extracted and predicted and furthermore, analyses of GO and KEGG assignments were performed. In addition, 60 putative genes of growth factors and their receptors from four species of pearl oysters were predicted. This study established an excellent resource for gene discovery and expression in pearl oysters, but also offered a significant platform for functional genomics and comparative genomic studies for mollusks.},

In this study, eight non-normalized and multiplex barcode-labeled transcriptomes were sequenced using a 454 GS system to cover the early developmental stages of the abalone H. diversicolor. The assembly generated 35,415 unigenes, of which 7,566 were assigned GO terms. A global gene expression profile containing 636 scaffolds/contigs was constructed and was proven reliable using qPCR evaluation. It indicated that there may be existing dramatic phase transitions. Bioprocesses were proposed, including the ‘lock system’ in mature eggs, the collagen shells of the trochophore larvae and the development of chambered extracellular matrix (ECM) structures within the earliest postlarvae. Conclusion
This study globally details the first 454 sequencing data for larval stages of H. diversicolor. A basic analysis of the larval transcriptomes and cluster of the gene expression profile indicates that each stage possesses a batch of specific genes that are indispensable during embryonic development, especially during the two-cell, trochophore and early postlarval stages. These data will provide a fundamental resource for future physiological works on abalones, revealing the mechanisms of settlement and metamorphosis at the molecular level.},

  Abstract                 = {Maximum life span differences among animal species exceed life span variation achieved by experimental manipulation by orders of magnitude. The differences in the characteristic maximum life span of species was initially proposed to be due to variation in mass-specific rate of metabolism. This is called the rate-of-living theory of aging and lies at the base of the oxidative-stress theory of aging, currently the most generally accepted explanation of aging. However, the rate-of-living theory of aging while helpful is not completely adequate in explaining the maximum life span. Recently, it has been discovered that the fatty acid composition of cell membranes varies systematically between species, and this underlies the variation in their metabolic rate. When combined with the fact that 1) the products of lipid peroxidation are powerful reactive molecular species, and 2) that fatty acids differ dramatically in their susceptibility to peroxidation, membrane fatty acid composition provides a mechanistic explanation of the variation in maximum life span among animal species. When the connection between metabolic rate and life span was first proposed a century ago, it was not known that membrane composition varies between species. Many of the exceptions to the rate-of-living theory appear explicable when the particular membrane fatty acid composition is considered for each case. Here we review the links between metabolic rate and maximum life span of mammals and birds as well as the linking role of membrane fatty acid composition in determining the maximum life span. The more limited information for ectothermic animals and treatments that extend life span (e.g., caloric restriction) are also reviewed.},

  Abstract                 = {Increasing temperatures and glacier melting at the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) are causing rapid changes in shallow coastal and shelf systems. Climate change-related rising water temperatures, enhanced ice scouring, as well as coastal sediment runoff, in combination with changing feeding conditions and microbial community composition, will affect all elements of the nearshore benthic ecosystem, a major component of which is the Antarctic soft-shelled clam \textit{Laternula elliptica}. A 454-based RNA sequencing was carried out on tissues and hemocytes of L. elliptica, resulting in 42,525 contigs, of which 48 % was assigned putative functions. Changes in the expression of putative stress response genes were then investigated in hemocytes and siphon tissue of young and old animals subjected to starvation and injury experiments in order to investigate their response to sedimentation (food dilution and starvation) and iceberg scouring (injury). Analysis of antioxidant defense (Le-SOD and Le-catalase), wound repair (Le-TIMP and Le-chitinase), and stress and immune response (Le-HSP70, Le-actin, and Le-theromacin) genes revealed that most transcripts were more clearly affected by injury rather than starvation. The upregulation of these genes was particularly high in the hemocytes of young, fed individuals after acute injury. Only minor changes in expression were detected in young animals under the selected starvation conditions and in older individuals. The stress response of L. elliptica thus depends on the nature of the environmental cue and on age. This has consequences for future population predictions as the environmental changes at the WAP will differentially impact L. elliptica age classes and is bound to alter population structure.},

  Abstract                 = {NF-?B is an inducible transcription factor that controls expression of diverse stress response genes. The entire mammalian NF-?B family is generated from a small cadre of five gene products that assemble with one another in various combinations to form active homo- and heterodimers. The ability of NF-?B to alter target gene expression is regulated at many levels. Chief among these regulatory mechanisms is the noncovalent association in the cell cytoplasm of NF-?B dimers with I?B inhibitor proteins. Removal of I?B leads to accumulation of active NF-?B within the cell nucleus where it binds to specific {DNA }sequences contained within the promoter regions of target genes and initiates recruitment of general transcription factors and assembly of the basal transcription machinery. Here we provide a detailed description of these fundamental NF-?B regulatory events using as a basis macromolecular structures and experimental data derived from structure-based biochemistry.},

  Abstract                 = {In The Netherlands, fishing for juvenile blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) on wild beds is gradually replaced by harvesting of seeds from suspended collectors. Both the relaxation of fishing as well as the up-scaling of the number of seed collectors are expected to result in an increase in the number of mussels in the Wadden Sea. Consequently, an enhanced mussel population will cause an additional filtration impact on the system. The question is raised to what extent collectors can be used without negatively affecting the carrying capacity of an ecosystem. Therefore, a monitoring programme was initiated to study the growth of juvenile mussels on suspended collectors. This growth was related to food availability, measured as chlorophyll-a, and temperature both before and after settlement. Findings will serve as input for mathematical models predicting the carrying capacity for mussel seed collectors in this area.The results for 2010 and 2011 are presented. In 2011 settled mussels achieved a higher growth rate, while phytoplankton concentrations after settlement were lower. This contradicts the general agreement that higher phytoplankton concentrations result in higher growth rates. A positive relation between chlorophyll-a concentrations during the larval period and the growth rate of settled mussels was found.The number of settled larvae was higher in 2011. Results from existing studies on settlement and recruitment on tidal flats combined with estimated settlement date in the current study led to the hypothesis that the number of settled mussels on rope collectors is inversely related to the duration of the larval period (determined by water temperature). Our results indicated that in the Wadden Sea, the intra-annual differences in chlorophyll-a and temperature did not have an impact on the juvenile growth rate, while the interannual differences did. This is an indication that the larval stage is strongly discriminative in terms of juvenile growth rates.Modelling growth of juvenile mussels on collectors should thus include conditions before settlement. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {A ?-1,3-glucan binding protein (?GBP) specific for laminarin (a ?-1,3-glucan) was detected for the first time in a mollusc, Perna viridis. ?GBP was isolated and purified from the plasma using laminarin precipitation and affinity chromatography on laminarin-Sepharose 6B, respectively. It agglutinated bakers yeast, bacteria, and erythrocytes and enhanced prophenoloxidase (proPO) activity of the plasma in a dose-dependent manner. The purified ?GBP appeared as a single band in native-PAGE and the purity was conformed by HPLC. The protein has a molecular weight estimate of 510 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and in isoelectric focusing the purified ?GBP was focused as a single band at pI 5.3. ?GBP was found to possess inherent serine protease activity but lacked ?-1,3-glucanase activity and all these results suggest that plasma ?GBP of P. viridis functions as a recognition molecule for ?-1,3-glucan on the surface of microbial cell walls. This recognition and binding lead to the activation of the prophenoloxidase cascade mediated by the inherent serine protease activity of ?GBP. Presence of agglutinating activity and serine protease activity shows that ?GBP is a bifunctional protein. The findings are discussed in light of the importance of this protein in the innate immune response of P. viridis, and they implicate evolutionary link with similar proteins found in other invertebrates.},

  Abstract                 = {The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, and the {Pacific} oyster, C. gigas, are species of global economic significance as well as important components of estuarine ecosystems and models for genetic and environmental studies. To enhance the molecular tools available for oyster research, an international group of collaborators has constructed a 27,496-feature c{DNA }microarray containing 4460 sequences derived from C. virginica, 2320 from C. gigas, and 16 non-oyster DNAs serving as positive and negative controls. The performance of the array was assessed by gene expression profiling using gill and digestive gland RNA derived from both C. gigas and C. virginica, and digestive gland RNA from C. ariakensis. The utility of the microarray for detection of homologous genes by cross-hybridization between species was also assessed and the correlation between hybridization intensity and sequence homology for selected genes determined. The oyster c{DNA }microarray is publicly available to the research community on a cost-recovery basis. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

They have also been reported to be involved in other processes requiring carbohydrate–lectin interactions such as symbiosis or fertilization. In this study, we report a novel putative C-type lectin (CvML) from the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica and we investigated its involvement in oyster physiology. The c{DNA }of this lectin is 610 bp long encoding for a 161-residue protein. CvML presents a signal peptide and a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) which contains a YPD motif and two putative conserved sites, WID and DCM, for calcium binding. CvML transcripts were expressed in mucocytes lining the epithelium of the digestive gland and the pallial organs (mantle, gills, and labial palps) but were not detected in other tissues including hemocytes. Its expression was significantly up-regulated following starvation or bacterial bath exposure but not after injection of bacteria into oyster's adductor muscle. These results highlight the potential role of CvML in the interactions between oyster and waterborne microorganisms at the pallial interfaces with possible involvement in physiological functions such as particle capture or mucosal immunity.},

  Abstract                 = {Vibrios are Gram-negative curved bacilli that occur naturally in marine, estuarine, and freshwater systems. Some species include human and animal pathogens, and some vibrios are necessary for natural systems, including the carbon cycle and osmoregulation. Countless \textit{in vivo} and \textit{in vitro} studies have examined the interactions between vibrios and their environment, including molecules, cells, whole animals, and abiotic substrates. Many studies have characterized virulence factors, attachment factors, regulatory factors, and antimicrobial resistance factors, and most of these factors impact the organism's fitness regardless of its external environment. This review aims to identify common attributes among factors that increase fitness in various environments, regardless of whether the environment is an oyster, a rabbit, a flask of immortalized mammalian cells, or a planktonic chitin particle. This review aims to summarize findings published thus far to encapsulate some of the basic similarities among the many vibrio fitness factors and how they frame our understanding of vibrio ecology. Factors representing these similarities include hemolysins, capsular polysaccharides, flagella, proteases, attachment factors, type III secretion systems, chitin binding proteins, iron acquisition systems, and colonization factors.},

  Abstract                 = {Pearl oysters are not only farmed for their gemstone quality pearls worldwide, but they are also becoming important model organisms for investigating genetic mechanisms of biomineralisation. Despite their economic and scientific significance, limited genomic resources are available for this important group of bivalves, hampering investigations into identifying genes that regulate important pearl quality traits and unique biological characteristics (i.e. biomineralisation). The silver-lipped pearl oyster, Pinctada maxima, is one species where there is interest in understanding genes that regulate commercially important pearl traits, but presently, there is a dearth of genomic information. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a large number of type I genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for P. maxima suitable for high-throughput genotyping. In addition, sequence annotations and Gene Ontology terms were assigned to a large mantle tissue 454 expressed sequence tag assembly (96,794 contigs) and information on known bivalve biomineralisation genes was incorporated into SNP discovery. The SNP discovery effort resulted in the de novo identification of 172,625 SNPs, of which 9,108 were identified as high value [minor allele frequency (MAF)???0.15, read depth???8]. Validation of 2,782 of these SNPs using Illumina iSelect Infinium genotyping technology returned some of the highest assay conversion (86.6 %) and validation (59.9 %; mean MAF 0.28) rates observed in aquaculture species to date. Genomic resources presented here will be pivotal to future research investigating the biological mechanisms behind biomineralisation and will form a strong foundation for genetic selective breeding programs in the P. maxima pearling industry.},

  Abstract                 = {Massive mortalities have been observed in France since 2008 on spat and juvenile {Pacific} oysters, \textit{Crassostrea gigas}. A herpes virus called OsHV-1, easily detectable by PCR, has been implicated in the mortalities as demonstrated by the results of numerous field studies linking mortality with OsHV-1 prevalence. Moreover, experimental infections using viral particles have documented the pathogenicity of OsHV-1 but the physiological responses of host to pathogen are not well known. Results:The aim of this study was to understand mechanisms brought into play against the virus during infection in the field. A microarray assay has been developed for a major part of the oyster genome and used for studying the host transcriptome across mortality on field. Spat with and without detectable OsHV-1 infection presenting or not mortality respectively were compared by microarray during mortality episodes. In this study, a number of genes are regulated in the response to pathogen infection on field and seems to argue to an implication of the virus in the observed mortality. The result allowed establishment of a hypothetic scheme of the host cell’s infection by, and response to, the pathogen. Conclusions:This response shows a“sensu stricto” innate immunity through genic regulation of the virus OsHV-1 life cycle, but also others biological processes resulting to complex interactions between host and pathogens in general},

  Abstract                 = {Global aquaculture has expanded rapidly to address the increasing demand for aquatic protein needs and an uncertain future for wild fisheries. To date, however, most farmed aquatic stocks are essentially wild and little is known about their genomes or the genes that affect important economic traits in culture. Biologists have recognized that recent technological advances including next generation sequencing (NGS) have opened up the possibility of generating genome wide sequence data sets rapidly from non-model organisms at a reasonable cost. In an era when virtually any study organism can ‘go genomic’, understanding gene function and genetic effects on expressed quantitative trait locus phenotypes will be fundamental to future knowledge development. Many factors can influence the individual growth rate in target species but of particular importance in agriculture and aquaculture will be the identification and characterization of the specific gene loci that contribute important phenotypic variation to growth because the information can be applied to speed up genetic improvement programmes and to increase productivity via marker-assisted selection (MAS). While currently there is only limited genomic information available for any crustacean species, a number of putative candidate genes have been identified or implicated in growth and muscle development in some species. In an effort to stimulate increased research on the identification of growth-related genes in crustacean species, here we review the available information on: (i) associations between genes and growth reported in crustaceans, (ii) growth-related genes involved with moulting, (iii) muscle development and degradation genes involved in moulting and (iv) correlations between {DNA }sequences that have confirmed growth trait effects in farmed animal species used in terrestrial agriculture and related sequences in crustacean species. The information in concert can provide a foundation for increasing the rate at which knowledge about key genes affecting growth traits in crustacean species is gained},

  Abstract                 = {The present research work was designed to study mussel’s (Mytilus galloprovincialis) digestive gland biotransformation and detoxification responses to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) exposure along with heat stress. Mussels were exposed to a sublethal dose of B[a]P [75 nM (19 ?g/L/animal)] + temperature gradient (18, 20, 22, 24 and 26 °C) for 7 days. B[a]P hydroxylase (BPH) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were assessed in digestive gland tissues as phase I and phase II biotransformation parameters. Catalase (CAT) activity and malonedialdehyde (MDA) were measured as potential biomarkers of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. The cholinergic system was evaluated using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. {DNA }damage was assessed using micronuclei (MN) test. BPH and GST activities showed a decreasing trend in B[a]P-exposed animals at 24 and 26 °C. CAT activity showed a bell-shaped response in B[a]P-exposed and in heat-stressed organisms at a maximum temperature of 22 °C. AChE activity was significantly inhibited in response to B[a]P being more pronounced at a temperature of 26 °C. MN in digestive gland cells suggest that B[a]P exposure induced significant {DNA }alteration with a maximum response in organisms coexposed to B[a]P and a temperature of 26 °C. Biomarker data are further discussed in relation B[a]P accumulation in mussels digestive gland. These data should be carefully considered in view of the biological effects of organic pollutants, particularly in organisms under the challenging effects of extreme temperature fluctuations},

  Abstract                 = {The hemocytes of invertebrates play key roles in both cellular and humoral immune reactions by phagocytosis or delivering immune factors such as lectin and anti-microbial peptides. Bacterial infection causes changes in components such as lectins, anti-bacterial peptides, and lysosomal enzymes of plasma or hemolymph in molluscs. Previously, we found that infection with the protozoan parasite, Perkinsus, increases lectin synthesis in hemocytes. In order to investigate the patterns of genes expressed in Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) infected with the protozoan parasite Perkinsus olseni, we constructed a c{DNA }library and sequenced 1850 clones (expressed sequence tags). A total of 79 ESTs, were related to 29 functional immune genes such as C-type lectin, lysozyme, and cystatin B, in Manila clams. Lectins were the largest group of immune-function ESTs found in our Manila clams library. Among 7 lectin clones, two full length cDNAs of lectins were cloned. MCL-3, which is a simple C-type lectin composed of 151 amino acids, has a relatively short signal sequence of 17aa and single carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of ?130 residues. It is highly homologous to eel C-type lectin. The sequence of mc-sialic acid-binding lectin consists of 168 amino acid residues with molecular weight of 19.2 and shows high homology to sialic acid-binding lectin from the snail, Cepaea hortensis.},

Although TLRs are critical for host defense, it has become apparent that loss of negative regulation of TLR signaling, as well as recognition of self molecules by TLRs, are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, it is now clear that the interaction between TLRs and recently identified cytosolic innate immune sensors is crucial for mounting effective immune responses. Here we describe the recent advances that have been made by research into the role of TLR biology in host defense and disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Resveratrol, a stilbene type compound identified in wine and fruit juice, has been found to exhibit various pharmacological activities such as anti-oxidative, anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and anti-aging effects. Although numerous papers have explored the pharmacology of resveratrol in one particular cellular action, how this compound can have multiple effects simultaneously has not been fully addressed. In this study, therefore, we explored its broad-spectrum inhibitory mechanism using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory responses and reporter gene assays involving overexpression of toll like receptor (TLR) adaptor molecules. Co-transfection of adaptor molecules such as (1) myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), (2) Toll/4Il-1 Receptor-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- (TRIF), (3) TRIFrelated adaptor molecule (TRAM), or (4) TANK-binding kinase (TBK) 1 strongly enhanced luciferase activity mediated by transcription factors including nuclear factor (NF)- B, activator protein (AP)-1, and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3. Of the adaptor proteins, TRIF and TBK1 but not MyD88 and IKK enhanced luciferase activity mediated by these transcription factors. Resveratrol dose-dependently suppressed LPS-induced NO production in macrophages. It also blocked the increases in levels of mRNA for IFN- , tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- , and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) that were induced by LPS. Resveratrol diminished the translocation or activation of IRF-3 at 90 min, c-Jun, a subunit of AP-1, and STAT-1 at 120 min, and p50, a subunit of NF- B, at 60 and 90 min. Resveratrol strongly suppressed the up-regulation of luciferase activity induced by these adaptor molecules with IC50 values of 5 to 65 M. In particular, higher inhibitory effects of resveratrol were when TRIF or TBK1 were overexpressed following cotransfection of luciferase constructs with IRF-3 binding sequences. Taken together, our data suggest that the suppression of TRIF and TBK1, which mediates transcriptional activation of NF- B, AP-1, and IRF-3, contributes to resveratrol's broad-spectrum inhibitory activity, and that this compound can be further developed as a lead anti-inflammatory compound.},

Despite decades of studies on the neurobiology and development of mollusks, comparatively little is known about the mechanisms of apoptosis in this phylum. In this review, an attempt is made to summarize data obtained on mollusks so far, and to discuss the molecular mechanisms, the functional and ecological significance of apoptosis and the advantages of snail preparations as tools for programmed cell death research. A definitive comparison of the data obtained on mollusks with those obtained on the more widely studied vertebrates, will contribute to the better understanding of the apoptotic process in general and of its evolutionary development.},

These larvae generated the lipoxygenase products, 12-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (HEPE), 8-HEPE and 8,15-diHEPE, together with the cyclooxygenase products, prostaglandin (PG) E, PGF and thromboxane (TX) B. Indomethacin, a selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PGE generation by B. amphitrite larvae, while esculetin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (lipoxygenase inhibitors) also strongly inhibited the generation of 8-HEPE, 12-HEPE and 8,15-diHEPE. PGE2, PGE3 and 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of settlement of B. amphitrite larvae while indomethacin (25–100 [mu]M) stimulated this process. Lipoxygenase products (8-HEPE, 12-HEPE and 8,15-diHEPE) as well as esculetin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10–100 [mu]M) had no effect on the attachment of larvae.},

  Abstract                 = {In this manuscript, I review the current and relevant classical studies on properties of the Mollusca heart and their central nervous system including ganglia, neurons, and nerves involved in cardiomodulation. Similar to mammalian brain hemispheres, these invertebrates possess symmetrical pairs of ganglia albeit visceral (only one) ganglion and the parietal ganglia (the right ganglion is bigger than the left one). Furthermore, there are two major regulatory drives into the compartments (pericard, auricle, and ventricle) and cardiomyocytes of the heart. These are the excitatory and inhibitory signals that originate from a few designated neurons and their putative neurotransmitters. Many of these neurons are well-identified, their specific locations within the corresponding ganglion are mapped, and some are termed as either heart excitatory (HE) or inhibitory (HI) cells. The remaining neurons are classified as cardio-regulatory, and their direct and indirect actions on the heart's function have been documented. The cardiovascular anatomy of frequently used experimental animals, Achatina, Aplysia, Helix, and Lymnaea is relatively simple. However, as in humans, it possesses all major components including even trabeculae and atrio-ventricular valves. Since the myocardial cells are enzymatically dispersible, multiple voltage dependent cationic currents in isolated cardiomyocytes are described. The latter include at least the A-type K +, delayed rectifier K +, TTX-sensitive Na +, and L-type Ca 2+ channels. © 2011.},

The resulting classifier is then used to assign class labels to the testing instances where the values of the predictor features are known, but the value of the class label is unknown. This paper describes various supervised machine learning classification techniques. Of course, a single article cannot be a complete review of all supervised machine learning classification algorithms (also known induction classification algorithms), yet we hope that the references cited will cover the major theoretical issues, guiding the researcher in interesting research directions and suggesting possible bias combinations that have yet to be explored.},

MLbase provides (1) a simple declarative way to specify ML tasks, (2) a novel optimizer to select and dynamically adapt the choice of learning algorithm, (3) a set of high-level operators to enable ML researchers to scalably implement a wide range of ML methods without deep systems knowledge, and (4) a new run-time optimized for the data-access patterns of these high-level operators},

The generalization performance achieved by a simple model ensemble of linear students is calculated exactly in the thermodynamic limit of a large number of input components and shows a surprisingly rich behavior. Our main findings are the following. For learning in large ensembles, it is advantageous to use underregularized students, which actually overfit the training data. Globally optimal generalization performance can be obtained by choosing the training set sizes of the students optimally. For smaller ensembles, optimization of the ensemble weights can yield significant improvements in ensemble generalization performance, in particular if the individual students are subject to noise in the training process. Choosing students with a wide range of regularization parameters makes this improvement robust against changes in the unknown level of corruption of the training data.},

  Abstract                 = {The hypobranchial gland present in gastropods is an organ whose function is not clearly understood. Involved in mucus production, within members of the family Muricidae it is also the source of the ancient dye Tyrian purple and its bioactive precursors. To gain further insights into hypobranchial gland biology, suppressive subtractive hybridisation was performed on hypobranchial gland and mantle tissue from the marine snail Dicathais orbita creating a differentially expressed c{DNA }library. 437 clones were randomly sequenced, analysed and annotated and 110 sequences had their functions putatively identified. Importantly this approach identified a putative gene involved in Tyrian purple biosynthesis, an arylsulphatase gene. Confirmation of the upregulation of arylsulphatase in the hypobranchial gland compared to the mantle was demonstrated using quantitative real-time PCR. Other genes identified as playing an important role in the hypobranchial gland were those involved in mucus protein synthesis, choline ester regulation, protein and energy production. This study confirms that the hypobranchial gland is involved in the production of mucus secretion and also identifies it as a site of chemical interaction and biosynthesis. This study lays the foundation for a better understanding of the enzymatic production of Tyrian purple precursors within the gland.},

  Abstract                 = {Bivalve hemocyte competence has been measured by quantifying functional characteristics, including reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) production after activation with zymosan or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). However, untreated oyster hemocytes also produce ROI and RNI (reactive nitrogen intermediates) after bleeding even if not stimulated by zymosan or PMA. Extensive investigation of this parameter by flow cytometry showed that, in vitro, ROI/RNI production by untreated hemocytes maintained in seawater appeared to be independent of both bacterial burden in the serum and non-self particle phagocytosis. ROI/RNI production in granulocytes was higher than in hyalinocytes and could be intensified when activated by zymosan but not by PMA. Both cell types used NADPH-oxidase- and NO-synthase-like pathways to produce these molecules; the NO-synthase pathway seemed relatively more dominant in hyalinocytes and NADPH-oxidase appeared more effective in granulocytes. These results provide new insights for interpreting the modulation of ROI/RNI production by untreated hemocytes shown by other studies, relative to environmental conditions or physiological status of the oysters.},

  Abstract                 = {Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a universal adaptor protein which is required for signal transduction of TLR/IL-1R family. In this study, a novel molluscan MyD88 family member protein (named as RpMyD88) was identified from manila clam, \textit{Ruditapes philippinarum}. It was identified using BLAST algorithm from GS-FLX™ sequencing data. The c{DNA }of RpMyD88 consists of 1416 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 471 amino acid residues. The RpMyD88 contains death domain and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain which are typical features of MyD88 family proteins. The predicted amino acid sequence of RpMyD88 shares 27% identity with scallop MyD88. The expression level of RpMyD88 mRNA was investigated in healthy and challenged clams by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The RpMyD88 gene expression is ubiquitous in all selected tissues. The RpMyD88 mRNA was strongly expressed in hemocyte, gill and mantle. In contrast, it was weakly expressed in siphon, foot and adductor muscle. RpMyD88 was up-regulated in gill and hemocyte after immune challenge with both Vibrio tapetis and LPS challenge. All results considered, sequence characterization, comparison and gene expression data suggesting that MyD88-dependent signaling pathway is presence in manila clam and RpMyD88 plays an important role in innate immune response against bacteria.},

  Abstract                 = {A temperature-sensitive mutation was obtained in Med6p, a component of the mediator complex from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mediator complex has been shown to enable transcriptional activation in vitro. This mutation in Med6p abolished activation of transcription from four of five inducible promoters tested in vivo. There was no effect, however, on uninduced transcription, transcription of constitutively expressed genes, or transcription by RNA polymerases I and III. Mediator-RNA polymerase II complex isolated from the mutant yeast strain was temperature sensitive for transcriptional activation in a reconstituted in vitro system due to a defect in initiation complex formation. A database search revealed the existence of MED6-related genes in humans and Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that the role of mediator in transcriptional activation is conserved throughout the evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are newly identified molecules shown to silence genes via targeted mRNA degradation. In this study, we used specific siRNAs as a tool to probe the relationship between two {DNA }methyltransferase genes, DNMT3b and DNMT1, in the maintenance of {DNA }methylation patterns in the genome. Levels of DNMT3b or DNMT1 mRNAs and proteins were markedly decreased (up to 80%) on transfecting these siRNAs into the ovarian cancer cell line CP70. The resulting RNA interference showed differential effects on {DNA }demethylation and gene reactivation in the treated cells. The DNMT1 siRNA treatment led to a partial removal of {DNA }methylation from three inactive promoter CpG islands, TWIST, RASSF1A, and HIN-1, and restored the expression of these genes. This epigenetic alteration appeared less effective in cells transfected with DNMT3b siRNA. However, the combined treatment of DNMT3b and DNMT1 siRNAs greatly enhanced this demethylation effect, producing 7–15-fold increases in their expression. We also used a microarray approach to examine this RNA interference on 8640 CpG island loci in CP70 cells. The combined siRNA treatment had a greater demethylation effect on 241 methylated loci and selected repetitive sequences than that of the single treatment. Our data thus suggest that whereas DNMT1 plays a key role in methylation maintenance, DNMT3b may act as an accessory to support the function in CP70 cells. This study also shows that siRNA is a powerful tool for interrogating the mechanisms of {DNA }methylation in normal and pathological genomes.},

  Abstract                 = {LPS-induced TNF-? (LITAF) is a novel transcriptional factor that mediates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced processes. In the present study, the full-length c{DNA }encoding LITAF (designated as Mm-LITAF) was identified from Asiatic hard clam, \textit{Meretrix meretrix}, by expressed sequence tag and rapid amplification of c{DNA }ends (RACE) approaches. The full-length c{DNA }of Mm-LITAF was 1653 bp, consisting of a 5? untranslated region (UTR) of 91 bp, a 3?UTR of 1166 bp with one cytokine RNA instability motif (ATTTA) and one polyadenylation signal (AATAAA), and an open reading frame (ORF) of 396 bp encoding a polypeptide of 131 amino acids with a theoretical isoelectric point of 7.49, and predicted molecular weight of 14.47 kDa. The deduced amino acid of Mm-LITAF shared 29–63% similarity with the LITAFs from other species, indicating that Mm-LITAF should be a member of the LITAF family. Two highly conserved CXXC motifs forming a compact Zn2+-binding structure were also identified in Mm-LITAF. A quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was developed to assess the expression of Mm-LITAF mRNA in different tissues, and the temporal expression of Mm-LITAF in clams challenged with Vibrio anguillarum. The mRNA transcript of Mm-LITAF could be detected in all the examined tissues with the highest expression level in the gill. Mm-LITAF expression was up-regulated significantly at 16 h in the gill and at 8 h in haemocytes after bacterial challenge, respectively. These results suggest that the Mm-LITAF is a constitutive and inducible acute-phase protein that perhaps involved in the innate immune response of hard clam.},

Diatom cells store a high amount of fatty acids, especially certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). However, many aspects of diatom metabolism and the production of PUFAs remain unclear. This review describes a number of technical strategies, such as modulation of environmental factors (temperature, light, chemical composition of culture medium) and culture methods, to influence the content of PUFAs in diatoms. Genetic engineering, a newly emerging field, also plays an important role in controlling the synthesis of fatty acids in marine microalgae. Several key points in the biosynthetic pathway of PUFAs in diatoms as well as recent progresses are also a critical part and are summarized here.},

  Abstract                 = {With rapid advancement of microarray technologies, biologists now can analysis thousands of gene expression values at one time. So they can have a 'global' view of the cell. Among all the problems during gene expression data analysis, the curse of dimensionality with thousands of gene expression values but only limited samples, commonly no more than one hundred, becomes more serious. The existence of numerous gene expression data, irrelevant to the classification of tumors, not only increases computational complexity but also makes the discovery of relevant genes impossible. Therefore, feature selection becomes critical important. In this paper, we first use a filter method to rank genes, and then select 'important' genes with high 'information exponential' score. Afterwards, we use a clustering method based on k-NN principle to find truly important genes. A support vector machine is applied to validate the classification performance of candidate genes. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effective solve the problem caused by filter method, which doesn't consider the relationships among genes.},

  Abstract                 = {High water temperatures are associated with immune suppression and elevated mortality in economically important marine bivalves. To determine whether the stimulatory effects of ?-glucan on enzymes associated with the immune system were depressed at higher temperatures, scallops \textit{Chlamys farreri} were treated with 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/ml of ?-glucan suspensions at 15 °C or 25 °C, and the activities of six enzymes (phenoloxidase (PO), acid phosphatase (ACP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) were measured in haemocytes every 12 h for seven days. The results showed that at 15 °C, compared to the control, the 0.5 mg/ml treatment resulted in significant induction of PO activity, the 1.0 mg/ml treatment stimulated PO, ACP, SOD, POD and MPO activities, and the 2.0 mg/ml treatment stimulated PO, ACP, SOD, POD and ALP activities (p < 0.05). At 25 °C, significant activation of PO activity was observed with the 0.5 mg/ml treatment, while PO, ACP and SOD activities were induced by the 1.0 mg/ml treatment and ACP activity by the 2.0 mg/ml treatment (p < 0.05); however, no significant induction of POD or MPO activity was observed. Surprisingly, ALP activity was undetectable at 25 °C throughout the entire experimental period. These results indicate that the 1.0 mg/ml ?-glucan treatment consistently had the highest stimulatory effect among the three concentrations. PO, ACP and SOD were more sensitive than POD, MPO and ALP to ?-glucan or temperature stress. The extent and duration of activation as well as the time of peak emergence for all six enzymes appeared higher, longer and earlier at 15 °C than 25 °C in all ?-glucan treatments, suggesting that high temperature may weaken or delay immune reactions to exogenous stress.},

In the present study, a high-quality c{DNA }library of the Japanese scallop was constructed from the kidney tissue. A total of 2919 expressed sequence tags longer than 100 bp were generated from this library. A cluster of 1440 unique sequences, which consisted of 258 contigs and 1182 singletons, was revealed. Based on blast searches, 882 (61.3%) genes had significant (E-value <1e–5) matches to known sequences in public databases. Among them, >70 genes were involved in stress response, immunity and apoptosis. These results expanded our knowledge of the genetics and physiology of the Japanese scallop, and provided a useful resource for gene discovery for further research of this species.},

  Abstract                 = {Marine mussels are renowned for their ability to produce an extra-organismic tendon-like structure that can withstand the wave forces associated with the intertidal habitat. Initial characterization of byssal properties has focused on Mytilus edulis, with few detailed comparisons with other mussels. M. galloprovincialis, a closely related species, provides an opportunity for a thorough comparison. Three full-length c{DNA }clones encoding the byssal collagens, precollagen D (preCol-D), preCol-NG and preCol-P, were isolated from M. galloprovincialis. Comparisons with M. edulis preCol-D, preCol-NG and preCol-P reveal a 91.3 %, 88.6 % and 90.1 % identity with the c{DNA }and an 89.0 %, 88.1 % and 89.0 % identity with the deduced protein sequences, respectively. Key elements are maintained between the species: in particular, modeled bends in the collagen helix due to breaks in the Gly-X-Y pattern and the location of cysteine and putative 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) residues. A potentially important difference between the two is that, in all cases, M. galloprovincialis byssal collagens contain additional histidine residues in their flanking domains. The significance of this may lie in the ability of M. galloprovincialis to utilize more metal chelate cross-links, which have been implicated in byssal thread stability.
M. edulis threads are typically twice the length and diameter of M. galloprovincialis threads and appear to contain nearly 10 % more collagen. These differences are maintained even when the different thread portions are compared. Despite differences in a number of parameters, most notably that whole M. galloprovincialis threads are stiffer, threads whether whole or separated into proximal and distal portions, have similar mechanical behaviors. It is apparent from this comparison that M. galloprovincialis and M. edulis are seemingly interchangeable models for byssal research.},

  Abstract                 = {Occurrence and level of hydrolytic enzymatic activity (proteases, glycosidases, phosphatases, lipases, and esterases) were studied in oocytes, larvae, juveniles, and adult haemolymph of the {Pacific} oyster \textit{Crassostrea gigas}. Samples were obtained as oocyte lysate supernatant, larval homogenate supernatant, juvenile homogenate supernatant, haemocyte lysate supernatant, and plasma. The presence of enzymes was demonstrated by colorimetric and lysoplate assay techniques. Between stages, significant differences in enzymatic activity determined by the colorimetric technique were found. Higher levels of enzymatic activity were found in the adult stage. Lysozyme-like activity was not found in oocytes, but was present in larvae, juveniles, and adults. In larvae, the highest lysozyme-like activity was in 3-d larvae. Juveniles had a 48-fold higher level of lysozyme-like activity, compared with 20-h larvae and was six-fold higher compared with 3-d larvae. In adults, lysozyme-like activity had a five-fold higher level in haemocyte lysate supernatant compared with plasma and was 98-fold higher compared with 20-h larvae. As determined with the API ZYM kit, 19 hydrolytic enzymatic activities were present, in oocytes, larvae, juveniles, and adult haemolymph of C. gigas. The presence of important lysozyme-like activity was confirmed from trochophora larvae (20 h) to adult stages.},

The advent of Next Generation Sequencing technology offers the possibility to better select control genes with the least cell to cell variability in steady state transcript levels. Here we analyze the transcriptomes of 55 leukemia samples to identify the most consistent genes. This list is enriched for components of the proteasome (ex. PSMA1) and spliceosome (ex. SF3B2), and also includes the translation initiation factor EIF4H, and many heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein genes (ex. HNRNPL). We have validated the consistency of our new control genes in 1933 cancer and normal tissues using publically available {RNA-seq} data, and their usefulness in qRT-PCR analysis is clearly demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {Rho GTPases play an important role in diverse biological processes such as actin cytoskeleton organization, gene transcription, cell cycle progression and adhesion. They are required during early Drosophila development for proper execution of morphogenetic movements of individual cells and groups of cells important for the formation of the embryonic body plan. We isolated loss-of-function mutations in the Drosophila Rho1 (Rho1) gene during a genetic screen for maternal-effect mutations, allowing us to investigate the specific roles Rho1 plays in the context of the developing organism. Here we report that Rho1 is required for many early events: loss of Rho1 function results in both maternal and embryonic phenotypes. Embryos homozygous for the Rho1 mutation exhibit a characteristic zygotic phenotype, which includes severe defects in head involution and imperfect dorsal closure. Two phenotypes are associated with reduction of maternal Rho1 activity: the actin cytoskeleton is disrupted in egg chambers, especially in the ring canals and embryos display patterning defects as a result of improper maintenance of segmentation gene expression. Despite showing imperfect dorsal closure, Rho1 does not activate downstream genes or interact genetically with members of the JNK signaling pathway, used by its relatives dRac and dCdc42 for proper dorsal closure. Consistent with its roles in regulating actin cytoskeletal organization, we find that Rho1 interacts genetically and physically with the Drosophila formin homologue, cappuccino. We also show that Rho1 interacts both genetically and physically with concertina, a G(alpha) protein involved in cell shape changes during gastrulation.},

These challenges include unpredictable sample populations, diverse genetic and environmental backgrounds of the animals, as well as the practical, legal and ethical issues involved in experimentation. The use of whole genome scale transcriptomics with animal samples obtained in a minimally invasive manner is an approach that shows promise for health assessment. In this study we assessed the utility of a microarray to identify changes in gene expression predictive of health status by interrogating blood samples from California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) in rehabilitation. A custom microarray was developed from the commercially available dog microarray (Canis familiaris) by selecting probes that demonstrated reliable cross-hybridization with RNA in sea lion blood. This custom microarray was used for the analysis of RNA from 73 sea lion blood samples, from animals with a broad spectrum of health changes. Both traditional classifying techniques and newer artificial neural network approaches correctly classified sea lions with respect to health status, primarily distinguishing between leptospirosis infection and domoic acid exposure. Real time PCR validation for a small set of genes, followed by sequencing, showed good correlation with array results and high identity (96-98%) between the dog and sea lion sequences. This approach to health status classification shows promise for disease identification in a clinical setting, and assessment of health status of wildlife. © 2011.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the identity, projection patterns, and functions of serotonergic neurons in juvenile and adult Aplysia are relatively well understood, little is known about the development of these cells. We have used light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry to investigate the genesis, differentiation, identity, and fate of the serotonergic cells in the embryonic, larval, and metamorphic stages of the life cycle of Aplysia. The results indicate that the first serotonergic cells emerge at midembryogenesis and that a total of five cells makes up the entire serotonergic system by hatching. These cells are part of a newly, discovered ganglion in Aplysia, called the apical ganglion. This serotonergic system of five cells remains essentially intact throughout larval development. The apical ganglion, together with its serotonergic cells, is resorbed at metamorphosis. A distinct set of serotonergic cells, which begins to emerge by the end of the larval period, is rapidly elaborated during the metamorphic and early juvenile periods to form the adult serotonergic system. These results support the view that the larval and adult forms of the Aplysia nervous system consist of entirely distinct sets of serotonergic cells, each adapted to the stage-specific morphological and behavioral characteristics of the animal.},

  Abstract                 = {Disseminated neoplasia (DN), an oyster disease resembling leukaemia, has been reported in a number of species of marine bivalve molluscs. The disease is characterised by a proliferation of abnormal circulating cells of unknown origin resulting in the invasion of tissues and organs, frequently with a fatal end of the affected individuals. To obtain a more comprehensive view of bivalve cancer processes, suppressive subtracted hybridisation (SSH) and quantitative RT-PCR (q-PCR) approaches were combined to investigate changes in the transcriptome of \textit{Ostrea edulis} haemolymph cells associated to DN. Two SSH libraries were constructed and 587 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced, obtaining 329 ESTs which showed expression changes in neoplastic process. Transcription expression analyses (q-PCR) were done for a total of 24 genes that could be relevant in neoplastic process, including genes with role in the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis or chromosomal defects. Most of those genes had not been reported in association with cancer in non-vertebrate organisms. The over-expression and under-expression of some of those genes in DN-affected oysters was in agreement with observations in vertebrate cancer. The results herein reported contribute to cancer understanding in bivalve molluscs.},

  Abstract                 = {In The Netherlands, fishing for juvenile blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) on wild beds is gradually replaced by harvesting of seeds from suspended collectors. Both the relaxation of fishing as well as the up-scaling of the number of seed collectors are expected to result in an increase in the number of mussels in the Wadden Sea. Consequently, an enhanced mussel population will cause an additional filtration impact on the system. The question is raised to what extent collectors can be used without negatively affecting the carrying capacity of an ecosystem. Therefore, a monitoring programme was initiated to study the growth of juvenile mussels on suspended collectors. This growth was related to food availability, measured as chlorophyll-a, and temperature both before and after settlement. Findings will serve as input for mathematical models predicting the carrying capacity for mussel seed collectors in this area.The results for 2010 and 2011 are presented. In 2011 settled mussels achieved a higher growth rate, while phytoplankton concentrations after settlement were lower. This contradicts the general agreement that higher phytoplankton concentrations result in higher growth rates. A positive relation between chlorophyll-a concentrations during the larval period and the growth rate of settled mussels was found.The number of settled larvae was higher in 2011. Results from existing studies on settlement and recruitment on tidal flats combined with estimated settlement date in the current study led to the hypothesis that the number of settled mussels on rope collectors is inversely related to the duration of the larval period (determined by water temperature). Our results indicated that in the Wadden Sea, the intra-annual differences in chlorophyll-a and temperature did not have an impact on the juvenile growth rate, while the interannual differences did. This is an indication that the larval stage is strongly discriminative in terms of juvenile growth rates.Modelling growth of juvenile mussels on collectors should thus include conditions before settlement. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {The Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, an ecologically and economically important estuarine organism, suffers mortalities as high as 90-100% in affected areas due to Roseovarius Oyster Disease (ROD), caused by the bacterial pathogen, Roseovarius crassostreae. Advanced genotypic breeding techniques necessitate information regarding markers and genes associated with disease resistance. As yet, the host-pathogen interaction between C. virginica and R. crassostreae is poorly understood at the molecular level. The identification of potential genes and pathways responsible for an effective host defense response in the Eastern oyster to R. crassostreae is important not only to provide a basis for enhanced breeding techniques, but also to enhance understanding of innate immunity in a broader, evolutionary sense. The present study proposed to uncover not only genes and general processes potentially involved in disease resistance to ROD in the Eastern oyster, but also diversified gene families. To that end the present study entailed a disease challenge exposing RODresistant and ROD-susceptible families of oysters to R. crassostreae, highthroughput c{DNA }sequencing of samples from several timepoints throughout the disease challenge, assembly of sequence data into a reference transcriptome, analysis of the transcriptome through differential gene expression and gene family similarity clustering, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection to identify candidate gene markers. Oyster resistance to R. crassostreae was found to involve extracellular matrix remodeling, cell adhesion, inflammation, metabolism, and other processes. Several gene families identified as putatively diversified and important in the oyster host defense response were enumerated and described, including serine proteases, serine protease inhibitors, c-type lectins, C1q domain-containing proteins, fibrinogen domain-containing proteins, scavenger receptors with class B SRCR domains, interferon-induced protein 44 (IFI44) family proteins, and GTPase of the immunity associated protein (GIMAP) family proteins. Further, similarity clustering of proteins and translated transcripts from diverse invertebrates suggested that GIMAP proteins are expanded in molluscs and IFI44 proteins are expanded in bivalves.}

  Abstract                 = {The {Pacific} oyster, \textit{Crassostrea gigas}, has developed special mechanisms to regulate its osmotic balance to adapt to fluctuations of salinities in coastal zones. To understand the oyster’s euryhaline adaptation, we analyzed salt stress effectors metabolism pathways under different salinities (salt 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 40 for 7 days) using transcriptome data, physiology experiment and quantitative real-time PCR. Results
Transcriptome data uncovered 189, 480, 207 and 80 marker genes for monitoring physiology status of oysters and the environment conditions. Three known salt stress effectors (involving ion channels, aquaporins and free amino acids) were examined. The analysis of ion channels and aquaporins indicated that 7 days long-term salt stress inhibited voltage-gated Na+/K+ channel and aquaporin but increased calcium-activated K+ channel and Ca2+ channel. As the most important category of osmotic stress effector, we analyzed the oyster FAAs metabolism pathways (including taurine, glycine, alanine, beta-alanine, proline and arginine) and explained FAAs functional mechanism for oyster low salinity adaptation. FAAs metabolism key enzyme genes displayed expression differentiation in low salinity adapted individuals comparing with control which further indicated that FAAs played important roles for oyster salinity adaptation. A global metabolic pathway analysis (iPath) of oyster expanded genes displayed a co-expansion of FAAs metabolism in C. gigas compared with seven other species, suggesting oyster’s powerful ability regarding FAAs metabolism, allowing it to adapt to fluctuating salinities, which may be one important mechanism underlying euryhaline adaption in oyster. Additionally, using transcriptome data analysis, we uncovered salt stress transduction networks in C. gigas. Conclusions
Our results represented oyster salt stress effectors functional mechanisms under salt stress conditions and explained the expansion of FAAs metabolism pathways as the most important effectors for oyster euryhaline adaptation. This study was the first to explain oyster euryhaline adaptation at a genome-wide scale in C. gigas.},

  Abstract                 = {New methods are needed for genomic-scale analysis of emerging model organisms that exemplify important biological questions but lack fully sequenced genomes. For example, there is an urgent need to understand the potential for corals to adapt to climate change, but few molecular resources are available for studying these processes in reef-building corals. To facilitate genomics studies in corals and other non-model systems, we describe methods for transcriptome sequencing using 454, as well as strategies for assembling a useful catalog of genes from the output. We have applied these methods to sequence the transcriptome of planulae larvae from the coral Acropora millepora. Results
More than 600,000 reads produced in a single 454 sequencing run were assembled into ~40,000 contigs with five-fold average sequencing coverage. Based on sequence similarity with known proteins, these analyses identified ~11,000 different genes expressed in a range of conditions including thermal stress and settlement induction. Assembled sequences were annotated with gene names, conserved domains, and Gene Ontology terms. Targeted searches using these annotations identified the majority of genes associated with essential metabolic pathways and conserved signaling pathways, as well as novel candidate genes for stress-related processes. Comparisons with the genome of the anemone Nematostella vectensis revealed ~8,500 pairs of orthologs and ~100 candidate coral-specific genes. More than 30,000 SNPs were detected in the coral sequences, and a subset of these validated by re-sequencing. Conclusion
The methods described here for deep sequencing of the transcriptome should be widely applicable to generate catalogs of genes and genetic markers in emerging model organisms. Our data provide the most comprehensive sequence resource currently available for reef-building corals, and include an extensive collection of potential genetic markers for association and population connectivity studies. The characterization of the larval transcriptome for this widely-studied coral will enable research into the biological processes underlying stress responses in corals and evolutionary adaptation to global climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {Growth rates in animals are governed by a wide range of biological factors, many of which remain poorly understood. To identify the genes that establish growth differences in bivalve larvae, we compared expression patterns in contrasting phenotypes (slow- and fast-growth) that were experimentally produced by genetic crosses of the {Pacific} oyster \textit{Crassostrea gigas}. Based on transcriptomic profiling of 4.5 million c{DNA }sequence tags, we sequenced and annotated 181 c{DNA }clones identified by statistical analysis as candidates for differential growth. Significant matches were found in GenBank for 43% of clones (N=78), including 34 known genes. These sequences included genes involved in protein metabolism, energy metabolism and regulation of feeding activity. Ribosomal protein genes were predominant, comprising half of the 34 genes identified. Expression of ribosomal protein genes showed non-additive inheritance — i.e. expression in fast-growing hybrid larvae was different from average levels in inbred larvae from these parental families. The expression profiles of four ribosomal protein genes (RPL18, RPL31, RPL352 and RPS3) were validated by RNA blots using additional, independent crosses from the same families. Expression of RPL35 was monitored throughout early larval development, revealing that these expression patterns were established early in development (in 2-day-old larvae). Our findings (i) provide new insights into the mechanistic bases of growth and highlight genes not previously considered in growth regulation, (ii) support the general conclusion that genes involved in protein metabolism and feeding regulation are key regulators of growth, and (iii) provide a set of candidate biomarkers for predicting differential growth rates during animal development.},

  Abstract                 = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that initiate an innate immune response contain an extracellular leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain and an intracellular Toll IL-receptor (TIR) domain. There are fifteen different TLRs in vertebrates. The LRR domains, which adopt a solenoid structure, usually have higher rates of evolution than do the TIR globular domains. It is important to understand the molecular evolution and functional roles of TLRs from this standpoint. Both pairwise genetic distances and Ka/Ks's (the ratios between non synonymous and synonymous substitution rates) were compared between the LRR domain and the TIR domain of 366 vertebrate TLRs from 96 species (from fish to primates). In fourteen members (TLRs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11/12, 13, 14, 21, and 22/23) the LRR domains evolved significantly more rapidly than did the corresponding TIR domains. The evolutionary rates of the LRR domains are significantly different among these members; LRR domains from TLR3 and TLR7 from primates to fishes have the lowest rate of evolution. In contrast, the fifteenth member, TLR10, shows no significant differences; its TIR domain is not highly conserved. The present results suggest that TLR10 may have a different function in signaling from those other members and that a higher conservation of TLR3 and TLR7 may reflect a more ancient mechanism and/or structure in the innate immune response system. Gene conversions are suggested to have occurred in platypus TLR6 and TLR10. This study provides new insight about structural and functional diversification of vertebrate TLRs.},

  Abstract                 = {The Manila clam,\textit{Ruditapes philippinarum}, is one of the major aquaculture species in the world and a potential sentinel organism for monitoring the status of marine ecosystems. However, genomic resources forR. philippinarumare still extremely limited. Global analysis of gene expression profiles is increasingly used to evaluate the biological effects of various environmental stressors on aquatic animals under either artificial conditions or in the wild. Here, we report on the development of a transcriptomic platform for global gene expression profiling in the Manila clam. Results:A normalized c{DNA }library representing a mixture of adult tissues was sequenced using a ultra highthroughput sequencing technology (Roche 454). A database consisting of 32,606 unique transcripts was constructed, 9,747 (30%) of which could be annotated by similarity. An oligo-{DNA }microarray platform was designed and applied to profile gene expression of digestive gland and gills. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes between different tissues was performed by enrichment analysis. Expression of Natural Antisense Transcripts (NAT) analysis was also performed and bi-directional transcription appears a common phenomenon in the R. philippinarumtranscriptome. A preliminary study on clam samples collected in a highly polluted area of the Venice Lagoon demonstrated the applicability of genomic tools to environmental monitoring. Conclusions:The transcriptomic platform developed for the Manila clam confirmed the high level of reproducibility of current microarray technology. Next-generation sequencing provided a good representation of the clam transcriptome. Despite the known limitations in transcript annotation and sequence coverage for non model species, sufficient information was obtained to identify a large set of genes potentially involved in cellular response to environmental stress.},

  Abstract                 = {Poor growth and survival of scallops is often reported during early developmental stages. Stage- and species-specific dietary requirements have been identified, but the mechanisms responsible for these differences remain largely unknown. Dietary success depends on food biochemical properties, digestive and/or assimilative capacity, as well as the animal’s specific nutritional demands, which can vary over development and between species. The present study examines developmental changes in the activities of key digestive enzymes in larval and postlarval bay scallops Argopecten irradians and sea scallops Placopecten magellanicus raised on a mixed algal diet until ~4 to 5 mm in shell height (SH) and sampled at intervals encompassing major transitions in feeding organ development. Colorimetric assays measured general protease, lipase (esterase) and carbohydrase (?-amylase, cellulase and laminarinase) activities. The most pronounced changes in enzymatic activity occurred prior to scallops attaining ~1.2 mm SH in both scallop species. The esterase:protease ratio exhibited similar ontogenetic patterns in both scallop species, decreasing sharply between larval and immediate postlarval stages before increasing to an intermediate level and stabilizing around 1.2 mm SH. In contrast, mean carbohydrase activities measured over the experimental duration differed between species, with bay scallops exhibiting higher specific activities of ?-amylase and cellulase but much lower activities of laminarinase than sea scallops. These findings have implications for understanding scallop utilization of the food supply in nature, as well as developing targeted diets that could enhance their growth and survival in culture.},

  Abstract                 = {While the larval-juvenile transition (metamorphosis) in the spionid polychaete Pseudopolydora vexillosa involves gradual morphological changes and does not require substantial development of juvenile organs, the opposite occurs in the barnacle Balanus amphitrite. We hypothesized that the proteome changes during metamorphosis in the spionids are less drastic than that in the barnacles. To test this, proteomes of pre-competent larvae, competent larvae (ready to metamorphose), and juveniles of P. vexillosa were compared using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), and they were then compared to those of the barnacle. Results
Unlike the significant changes found during barnacle metamorphosis, proteomes of competent P. vexillosa larvae were more similar to those of their juveniles. Pre-competent larvae had significantly fewer protein spots (384 spots), while both competent larvae and juveniles expressed about 660 protein spots each. Proteins up-regulated during competence identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis included a molecular chaperon (calreticulin), a signal transduction regulator (tyrosin activation protein), and a tissue-remodeling enzyme (metallopeptidase). Conclusions
This was the first time to study the protein expression patterns during the metamorphosis of a marine polychaete and to compare the proteomes of marine invertebrates that have different levels of morphological changes during metamorphosis. The findings provide promising initial steps towards the development of a proteome database for marine invertebrate metamorphosis, thus deciphering the possible mechanisms underlying larval metamorphosis in non-model marine organisms.},

Here we describe the analysis of Cg-timp expression in oysters challenged by live or dead bacteria as well as by bacterial secretory/excretory products and metalloproteinase. Surprisingly, bacterial secretory/excretory products activate Cg-timp gene expression whereas heat-inactivated ones do not. To address the question of the signal transduction pathway involved in Cg-timp gene activation, we isolated and sequenced Cg-timp promoter and upstream region. A 1-kb genomic {DNA }fragment flanking the 5?-end of the gene contains several regulatory elements and notably three NF-?B binding sites. The potential involvement of these motifs in Cg-timp gene regulation is discussed.},

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that Cg-Rel shares the structural organization of Rel/NF-?B transcription factors of class II. It includes a Rel homology domain as well as a C-terminal transactivation domain (TD). Overexpression of Cg-Rel in the Drosophila S2 cell line activated the expression of a NF-?B-dependent reporter gene, whereas transfection with a Cg-Rel construct containing a C-terminal deletion of the TD or using a reporter gene with mutated ?B binding sites failed to activate expression. These results suggest that Cg-Rel is a functional member of the Rel family of transcription factors, making this the sixth structurally homologous component of the Rel/NF-?B pathway characterized in C. gigas. Based on homology to other invertebrates’ Rel/NF-?B cascade, the function of the oyster pathway may serve to regulate genes involved in innate defense and/or development. These findings serve to highlight a potentially important regulatory pathway to the study of oyster immunology, hence allowing comparison of the immune system in vertebrates and invertebrates, an important key issue to understand its evolution.},

Sequence analysis of the two transcripts showed that they originate from two distinct genes. The two proteins, Cg-TIMP 1.1 and 1.3, are closely related and share 81% identity. Northern blot analysis of Cg-timp gene expression in adult oyster hemocytes indicated that the ratio between the two transcripts was constant from one oyster to another (Cg-timp 1.1 and 1.3 represent 32 and 68%, respectively). Conversely, during ontogenesis the expression pattern of the two Cg-timp genes was different. Indeed, Cg-timp 1.3 mRNAs were detected from the larval D stage whereas Cg-timp 1.1 transcripts were undetectable up to 22 days post-fertilization. The difference in expression pattern of the two Cg-timp genes may reveal distinct implications of these genes in the embryos and larvae developments.},

  Abstract                 = {The Manila clam (\textit{Ruditapes philippinarum}) is a worldwide cultured bivalve species with important commercial value. Diseases affecting this species can result in large economic losses. Because knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of the immune response in bivalves, especially clams, is scarce and fragmentary, we sequenced RNA from immune-stimulated R. philippinarum hemocytes by 454-pyrosequencing to identify genes involved in their immune defense against infectious diseases. Methodology and Principal Findings
High-throughput deep sequencing of R. philippinarum using 454 pyrosequencing technology yielded 974,976 high-quality reads with an average read length of 250 bp. The reads were assembled into 51,265 contigs and the 44.7% of the translated nucleotide sequences into protein were annotated successfully. The 35 most frequently found contigs included a large number of immune-related genes, and a more detailed analysis showed the presence of putative members of several immune pathways and processes like the apoptosis, the toll like signaling pathway and the complement cascade. We have found sequences from molecules never described in bivalves before, especially in the complement pathway where almost all the components are present. Conclusions
This study represents the first transcriptome analysis using 454-pyrosequencing conducted on R. philippinarum focused on its immune system. Our results will provide a rich source of data to discover and identify new genes, which will serve as a basis for microarray construction and the study of gene expression as well as for the identification of genetic markers. The discovery of new immune sequences was very productive and resulted in a large variety of contigs that may play a role in the defense mechanisms of \textit{Ruditapes philippinarum}.},

Because the molecular mechanism of the immune response of bivalves, especially clams, is scarce and fragmentary, we have examined all Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) resources available in public databases for these two species in order to increase our knowledge on genes related with the immune function in these animals. After automatic annotation and classification of the 3784 not-annotated ESTs of R. decussatus and 4607 of R. philippinarum found in GenBank, 424 ESTs of R. decussatus and 464 of R. philippinarum were found to be putatively involved in immune response. These were carefully reviewed and reannotated. As a result, 13 immune-related ESTs were selected and studied to compare the immune response of R. decussatus and R. philippinarum following a Vibrio alginolyticus challenge. Quantitative PCR was performed, and the expression of each EST was determined. The results showed that, in R. philippinarum, the immune response seems to be faster than that in R. decussatus. Additionally, expression of NF-?B activating genes in R. decussatus did not seem to be sufficient to promote an immune response after Vibrio infection. R. philippinarum, however, was able to trigger and efficiently regulate the transcriptional activity of NF-?B, even when low expression values were reported.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent progress narrowing the gaps between molecular biology, studies of larval settlement and metamorphosis, and field studies of recruitment of benthic invertebrates is discussed. Evidence is presented that the stringent and specific requirements of developmentally arrested larvae for exogenous chemical inducers in many cases determine the site-specificity of settlement, metamorphosis and recruitment in the ocean environment. The complexity of recently revealed larval chemosensory mechanisms controlling metamorphosis in response to both substratum-associated and water-borne chemical cues, and the sensitivity of these systems to regulation at multiple levels, confer on the larvae of some species a capacity for fine-scale discrimination of (and responsiveness to) chemical features of the environment that had not been anticipated a few years ago. Larval settlement and metamorphosis in stringently cue-dependent species are not largely random events, as first had been widely thought, but instead are highly determined by chemosensory recognition of morphogenic and regulatory molecules in the environment. A new synthesis incorporating the role of these mechanisms is required to better understand the ecology of recruitment and reproductive success in such species, and their evolution. A summary of what is known at the molecular level about the control of settlement and metamorphosis in Phragmalopoma californica (polychaete annelid) and Haliolis rufescens (gastropod mollusc) larvae, and of the multiple, independent lines of evidence by which it is known, is presented. Recent evidence casting doubt on the relevance of fatty acids (known effectors of cyclic AMP in many systems) as environmentally important inducers of P. californica is summarized. New developments in the identification, partial purification, and analyses (both in vitro and in vivo) of the larval Haliolis receptors and signal transducers responsible for the recognition of environmentally deployed morphogens and regulatory molecules, and studies of their roles in the control of settlement and metamorphosis, are reviewed. Thus far, 10 of the 13 separate receptor-dependent and signal-transduction reactions and pathways that were first identified or deduced from experiments performed in vivo have now been verified in vitro, in analyses conducted with purified epithelia cilia containing populations of chemosensory cilia from the larvae. These recent in vitro observations thus substantially confirm the mechanisms controlling metamorphosis that had been suggested from experiments in vivo. At the molecular and cellular levels, the receptors and signal transducers that control metamorphosis are proving to be structually, functionally, and evolutionarily closely related to receptors and transducers that control developmental, sensory, neuronal and hormonal processes in numerous other systems. Information learned from analyses of these components and their mechanisms of action in marine invertebrate larvae thus should be widely applicable to the understanding of developmental and sensory processes in other animals. The need for a coordinated genetic and molecular dissection of the complex processes controlling the differential activation of gene expression and development in marine invertebrate larvae in response to environmental morphogens, in experimentally tractable systems, is discussed.},

Development from induced spawning to metamorphosed juveniles is described by using light and scanning electron microscopy. The shell-field appears at the gastrula stage, 6 h after fertilization, and rapid embryonic development results in straight-hinge veligers, 18 h after fertilization. These swimming veligers develop to swimming-crawling pediveligers, then to benthic plantigrades with functional elongated gill filaments without interruption in 15 days. The transitional arched structures observed at the end of the pediveliger stage were called‘ ctenidial crypts’ to distinguish them from functional gill filaments which exist only in metamorphosed juveniles. Metamorphosis, which occurs without a special environmental cue, is completed with the differentiation of the siphons in 300?m juveniles. Thus, there is no delay of metamorphosis in this species whereas a developmental hiatus has been described in most planktotrophic bivalves. Juveniles, 1 mm in shell-length with the triangular shape, pointed posterior end and brown zig-zag stripes on the shell, typical of A. brasiliana have been obtained 7 weeks after fertilization. However, a large variability of individual sizes and developmental stages within the same batches may indicate a high genetic variability.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge on the importance of associations between bacteria and microalgae in aquatic ecosystems is rather limited at the moment, mostly due to a lack of studies at the molecular and biochemical level of microorganisms. This paper discusses the current knowledge on microalgae–bacteria interactions and their potential impacts on the productivity, efficiency and sustainability of aquaculture. Current findings suggest that the interactions are complex and specific. The release of stimulatory products by bacteria that enhance the growth of microalgae, and vice versa, indicates the existence of mutualistic relations. Other factors, such as signalling between bacteria and microalgae, may also play an important role. Although these interactions may be of significant importance, to date, only a few findings have been reported on the use of consortia consisting of microalgae and bacteria for practical purposes. Interestingly, these results pointed out that a combination of microalgae and bacteria is often better than using either of them alone. Further research is needed to obtain a thorough understanding of the mechanisms behind the interactions between these microorganisms, including the identification of active compounds. This knowledge will enable the selection of appropriate consortia for different applications in aquaculture, including disease control and high and sustainable production of feed.},

We further discuss factors that are pertinent when gene ontologies are used in animals with little earlier work combining genomic and functional data. We then review issues relating to transcription, especially transcription factor function and gene regulatory pathways. As the most important single factor affecting gene expression is translation, we emphasize the need to relate mRNA and protein level findings whenever functional inferences are made. We finish with considering the possible roles of functional genomics studies in aquatic environmental research. We have concentrated especially on fish, although many of the points made are common to all eukaryotes.},

In ecotoxicogenomics the toxicological responses must further be combined with responses to natural environmental changes. We focus on fish, but also consider commonly used invertebrates, mainly Daphnia. We first go through the toxicologically important features of genomes of aquatic animals, and then review the reference gene approach to quantify transcript amount. Thereafter we emphasize the need to relate the mRNA and protein levels, and protein activity of individual genes. Finally we discuss how functional genomic investigations may be important in resolving current environmental problems and give our views of valuable future research topics.},

  Abstract                 = {Cathepsin B, a lysosomal cysteine protease, has drawn much attention in vertebrates. However, very little is known about the functions of cathepsin B in bivalves. In this study, we identified the cathepsin B gene in the razor clam Sinonovacula constricta. The protein has a typical cysteine protease structure, comprising a 15-residue putative signal peptide, a 75-residue propeptide and a 249-residue mature domain. In the mature domain, there is an occluding loop, an oxyanion hole (Gln) and a catalytic triad (Cys, His and Asn). The cathepsin B gene is expressed in a wide range of tissues but appears to exhibit greatest level of expression in the liver. During the early developmental stages, the transcript could be detected widely. After the clam was infected with Vibrio anguillarum, the expression of the cathepsin B gene showed the most significant up-regulation in the liver and mantle tissues at 8 h after infection. The fact that bacterial infection can induce the expression of the cathepsin B transcript suggests that cathepsin B could play an important role in the innate immunity of clams.},

  Abstract                 = {The razor clam Sinonovacula constricta is a benthic intertidal bivalve species with important commercial value. Despite its economic importance, knowledge of its transcriptome is scarce. Next generation sequencing technologies offer rapid and efficient tools for generating large numbers of sequences, which can be used to characterize the transcriptome, to develop effective molecular markers and to identify genes associated with growth, a key breeding trait. Results
Total RNA was isolated from the mantle, gill, liver, siphon, gonad and muscular foot tissues. High-throughput deep sequencing of S. constricta using 454 pyrosequencing technology yielded 859,313 high-quality reads with an average read length of 489 bp. Clustering and assembly of these reads produced 16,323 contigs and 131,346 singletons with average lengths of 1,376 bp and 458 bp, respectively. Based on transcriptome sequencing, 14,615 sequences had significant matches with known genes encoding 147,669 predicted proteins. Subsequently, previously unknown growth-related genes were identified. A total of 13,563 microsatellites (SSRs) and 13,634 high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphism loci (SNPs) were discovered, of which almost half were validated. Conclusion
De novo sequencing of the razor clam S. constricta transcriptome on the 454 GS FLX platform generated a large number of ESTs. Candidate growth factors and a large number of SSRs and SNPs were identified. These results will impact genetic studies of S. constricta.},

  Abstract                 = {Most components of the human complement system have unmistakable domain architectures, making evolutionary tracing feasible. In contrast to the major genes of the adaptive immune system, which are present only in jawed vertebrates, complement component genes with unique domain structures are present not only in jawed vertebrates but also in jawless fish and non-vertebrate deuterostomes. Recent progress in genome analysis in several eukaryotes, occupying the phylogenetically critical positions, showed that most individual domains found in the complement components are metazoa specific, being found both in deuterostomes and in protostomes but not in yeast or plant. However, unique domain architecture of complement components is not present in protostomes, suggesting that the complement system has been established in the deuterostome lineage not by invention of new domains but by innovation of unique combination of the pre-existing domains. The recently assembled Ciona intestinalis draft genome contained the most modular complement genes, except for factor I. However, some possible C. intestinalis complement components show critical structural divergence from the mammalian counterparts, casting doubt on their mutual interaction. Thus, another integrative step seems to have been required to establish the modern complement system of higher vertebrates.},

Components of both productive folding and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) mechanisms are known to be up-regulated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). We describe two novel components of mammalian ERAD, Derlin-2 and -3, which show weak homology to Der1p, a transmembrane protein involved in yeast ERAD. Both Derlin-2 and -3 are up-regulated by the UPR, and at least Derlin-2 is a target of the IRE1 branch of the response, which is known to up-regulate ER degradation enhancing ?-mannosidase–like protein (EDEM) and EDEM2, receptor-like molecules for misfolded glycoprotein. Overexpression of Derlin-2 or -3 accelerated degradation of misfolded glycoprotein, whereas their knockdown blocked degradation. Derlin-2 and -3 are associated with EDEM and p97, a cytosolic ATPase responsible for extraction of ERAD substrates. These findings indicate that Derlin-2 and -3 provide the missing link between EDEM and p97 in the process of degrading misfolded glycoproteins.},

Indirect immunofluorescence with the polyclonal antibody against mussel twitchin, a protein of thick filaments, and fluorescent phalloidin as a marker of filamentous cell actin were used to monitor changes in the developing muscle system at different larval stages. The first definitive muscle structures were found at the late trochophore stage (36 h after fertilization) and starting from the midveliger stage (96h), striated muscles, which are never present in adult mussels, were distinctly seen. The striated muscle periodicity was 1.25 ?m in both mussel larvae and adult scallop. The contractile activities of veliger and adult muscles were measured using an electronic signal-processing video workstation. This work is the first complex study of morphological, biochemical, and physiological characteristics of the muscle system in the larvae and adult molluscs.},

  Abstract                 = {Molluscan in vitro technology allows the study of the differentiation of isolated cells undergoing experimental manipulations. We have used the immunofluorescence technique and laser scanning microscopy to investigate the organization of muscle proteins (actin, myosin, paramyosin, and twitchin) and the localization of neurotransmitters (serotonin and FMRFamide) in cultured mussel larval cells. Differentiation into muscle and neuron-like cells occurs during the cultivation of mussel cells from premyogenic and prenervous larval stages. Muscle proteins are colocalized in contractile cells through all stages of cultivation. The cultivation of mussel cells on various substrates and the application of integrin receptor blockers suggest that an integrin-dependent mechanism is involved in cell adhesion and differentiation. Dissociated mussel cells aggregate and become self-organized in culture. After 20 days of cultivation, they form colonies in which serotonin- and FMRFamide-immunoreactive cells are located centrally, whereas muscle cells form a contractile network at the periphery. The pattern of thick and thin filaments in cultivated mussel cells changes according to the scenario of muscle arrangement in vivo: initially, a striated pattern of muscle filaments forms but is then replaced by a smooth muscle pattern with a diffuse distribution of muscle proteins, typical of muscles of adult molluscs. Myogenesis in molluscs thus seems to be a highly dynamic and potentially variable process. Such a “flexible” developmental program can be regarded as a prerequisite for the evolution of the wide variety of striated and smooth muscles in larval and adult molluscs.},

  Abstract                 = {The existence and function of actin in the nucleus has been hotly debated for forty years. Recently, ?-actin was found to be a component of mammalian SWI/SNF-like BAF chromatin remodeling complexes and still more recently other SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complexes in yeast, flies, and man. Although the function of actin in these chromatin remodeling complexes is only starting to be explored, the fact that actin is one of the most regulated proteins in the cell suggests that control of nuclear actin may be a critical regulatory point in the control of chromatin remodeling. Actin rapidly shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm offering additional sites and modes of regulation. In addition, actin-related proteins (Arps) are also components of these chromatin remodeling complexes and have been implicated in transcriptional control in yeast. The observation that the BAF chromatin remodeling complex in which actin was originally identified, is also a human tumor suppressor complex necessary for the actions of the retinoblastoma protein indicates that the study of nuclear actin is likely to contribute to understanding cell growth control.},

  Abstract                 = {The eye has evolved across 13 separate lineages of molluscs. Yet, there have been very few studies examining the molecular machinary underlying eye function of this group, which is due, in part, to a lack of genomic resources. The scallop (Bivalvia: Pectinidae) represents a compeling molluscan model to study photoreception due to its morphologically novel and separately evolved mirror-type eye. We sequenced the adult eye transcriptome of two scallop species to: 1) identify the phototransduction pathway components; 2) identify any additional light detection functions; and 3) test the hypothesis that molluscs possess genes not found in other animal lineages. Results
A total of 3,039 contigs from the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians and 26,395 contigs from the sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus were produced by 454 sequencing. Targeted BLAST searches and functional annotation using Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways identified transcripts from three light detection systems: two phototransduction pathways and the circadian clock, a previously unrecognized function of the scallop eye. By comparing the scallop transcriptomes to molluscan and non-molluscan genomes, we discovered that a large proportion of the transcripts (7,776 sequences) may be specific to the scallop lineage. Nearly one-third of these contain transmembrane protein domains, suggesting these unannotated transcripts may be sensory receptors. Conclusions
Our data provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic resource currently available from a single molluscan eye type. Candidate genes potentially involved in sensory reception were identified, and are worthy of further investigation. This resource, combined with recent phylogenetic and genomic data, provides a strong foundation for future investigations of the function and evolution of molluscan photosensory systems in this morphologically and taxonomically diverse phylum.},

  Abstract                 = {Hybrid zones are noteworthy systems for the study of environmental adaptation to fast-changing environments, as they constitute reservoirs of polymorphism and are key to the maintenance of biodiversity. They can move in relation to climate fluctuations, as temperature can affect both selection and migration, or remain trapped by environmental and physical barriers. There is therefore a very strong incentive to study the dynamics of hybrid zones subjected to climate variations. The infaunal bivalve Macoma balthica emerges as a noteworthy model species, as divergent lineages hybridize, and its native NE {Atlantic} range is currently contracting to the North. To investigate the dynamics and functioning of hybrid zones in M. balthica, we developed new molecular markers by sequencing the collective transcriptome of 30 individuals. Ten individuals were pooled for each of the three populations sampled at the margins of two hybrid zones. A single 454 run generated 277 Mb from which 17K SNPs were detected. SNP density averaged 1 polymorphic site every 14 to 19 bases, for mitochondrial and nuclear loci, respectively. An scan detected high genetic divergence among several hundred SNPs, some of them involved in energetic metabolism, cellular respiration and physiological stress. The high population differentiation, recorded for nuclear-encoded ATP synthase and NADH dehydrogenase as well as most mitochondrial loci, suggests cytonuclear genetic incompatibilities. Results from this study will help pave the way to a high-resolution study of hybrid zone dynamics in M. balthica, and the relative importance of endogenous and exogenous barriers to gene flow in this system.},

  Abstract                 = {To assess the potential of the bearded horse mussel (Modiolus barbatus) and Noah’s Ark shell (Arca noae) for aquaculture in southern Croatia, we analyzed their survival and growth rates under two experimental conditions—suspended culture and on-bottom culture. Furthermore, we investigated feeding on zooplankton by these two species in suspended culture conditions and compared them with previously published results of their feeding on zooplankton in the natural benthic environment. Experimental studies were conducted in Mali Ston Bay (Adriatic Sea) from December 2009 to December 2010. Differences were observed in terms of survival of tagged M. barbatus and A. noae—specimens of M. barbatus exhibited much better survival rates both in suspended culture and in on-bottom cages than did A. noae. Growth of A. noae under both culture conditions was essentially negligible, while M. barbatus grew several times faster in suspended culture than on the bottom. Values for the growth constant K and L inf for M. barbatus in suspended culture were 0.45 year?1 and 55.9 mm, while corresponding values for on-bottom culture were 0.09 year?1 and 58.6 mm, respectively. Zooplankters were present in the stomachs of 86.3 % of M. barbatus and 86.4 % of A. noae. Most abundant taxa were bivalve larvae followed by tintinnids, copepods, unidentified eggs and gastropod larvae. In conclusion, this study clearly shows that M. barbatus is a promising candidate for suspended aquaculture in southern Croatia.},

  Abstract                 = {Defensin is one of the most important antimicrobial peptides(AMPs) in bivalves and is involved in the immune responses. Herein, we reported the isolation and initial characterization of a defensin from the freshwater pearl mussel, Hyriopsis schlegelii (designated as Hs-defn) and its immune response for the first time. The full length Hs-defn c{DNA }was 410 bp long and consisted of a 51 bp 5'UTR, a 161 bp 3'UTR with a mRNA instability motif (AATAAA) and an open reading frame(ORF) of 198 bp encoding a polypeptide of 65 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of Hs-defn shared certain common features of AMPs, such as ?-helical structure, net positive charge, lower molecular mass and high hydrophobic residue ratio. Homologue searching against GenBank database suggested that Hs-Defn was also phylogenetically close to the defensin isoforms identified from other mollusks. Furthermore, predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of Hs-Defn demonstrated a significant similarity with other known defensins such as oyster C. gigas and insect P. terraenovae defensins. Phylogenetic analysis results further revealed that Hs-defn is a member of invertebrate defensin family.
Results of tissue specific analysis showed that the expression level of Hs-defn mRNA was the highest in haemocytes, moderate in gill, hepatopancrease, mantle and intestine, the lowest in foot, adductor muscle, gonad and kidney. After pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila stimulation, the Hs-defn mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated at 2 h and 12 h in haemocytes, gill, mantle and hepatopancrease. These results implicated that Hs-Defn was a constitutive and inducible acute-phase protein which was perhaps involved in the immune defense of pearl mussel.},

  Abstract                 = {Settlement behavior of molluscan veliger larvae prior to metamorphosis requires cessation of swimming, accomplished by arrest of prototrochal cilia on the margin of the velum (the larval swimming organ). Ciliary arrest in larvae of gastropods is mediated by an action potential that occurs synchronously across the velum as a consequence of electrical coupling between the prototrochal ciliated cells. We developed a preparation for extracellular recording of such ciliary arrest spikes from intact swimming and crawling veliger larvae of the caenogastropod Crepidula fornicata, using a fine wire electrode. Ciliary arrest spike rates during bouts of substrate crawling were significantly higher than those recorded during preceding swimming periods in larvae that were competent for metamorphosis, but not in precompetent larvae. Spike rates were similar on clean polystyrene substrates, and on substrates that had been coated with a natural cue for metamorphosis (mucus from conspecific adults). We used immunohistochemical methods to localize neuromodulators that might regulate the function of velar cilia. Labeled terminals for serotonin, FMRFamide, and tyrosine hydroxylase (an enzyme for catecholamine synthesis) were located in positions consistent with modulatory effects on the prototrochal ciliated cells. Prototrochal ciliary arrest spike rates and beat frequencies were measured in isolated velar lobes from competent larvae, which were exposed to serotonin, FMRFamide, and dopamine (10?5 mol L?1). Serotonin abolished arrest spiking and increased beat frequency; dopamine also increased beat frequency, and FMRFamide depressed it. Competent larvae tested in a small static water column swam to the top of the column when exposed to serotonin, but occupied lower positions than controls when in the presence of dopamine and FMRFamide. The larval nervous system appears to regulate velar functions that are critical for settlement behavior, and is likely to do so by integrating different sensory modalities in an age-dependent manner.},

  Abstract                 = {The hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, has been affected by severe mortality episodes associated with the protistan parasite QPX (Quahog Parasite Unknown) for several years. Despite the commercial importance of hard clams in the United States, molecular bases of defense mechanisms in M. mercenaria, especially during QPX infection, remain unknown. Results
Our study used suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), as well as the construction of c{DNA }libraries from hemocytes to identify genes related to the defense of the hard clam against its parasite. Hard clams were experimentally infected with QPX and SSH was performed on mRNA samples extracted from mantle and gill tissues at different times post-challenge. A total of 298 clones from SSH libraries and 1352 clones from c{DNA }libraries were sequenced. Among these sequences, homologies with genes involved in different physiological processes related to signal transduction, stress response, immunity and protein synthesis were identified. Quantitative PCR revealed significant changes in the expression of several of these genes in response to QPX challenge and demonstrated significant correlations in terms of levels of gene expression between intermediates of signalling pathways and humoral defense factors, such as big defensin and lysozyme. Conclusion
Results of this study allowed the detection of modifications caused by QPX at the transcriptional level providing insight into clam immune response to the infection. These investigations permitted the identification of candidate genes and pathways for further analyses of biological bases of clam resistance to QPX allowing for a better understanding of bivalve immunity in general.},

  Abstract                 = {The diatom Chaetoceros calcitrans is a major component of many bivalve hatcheries, yet it is expensive and notoriously difficult to culture on a commercial scale. In an attempt to reduce dependence on the diatom C. calcitrans, mussel larvae (\textit{Mytilus galloprovincialis}) were subjected to feeding experiments which altered levels of the diatom under controlled hatchery conditions. Growth, survival and settlement success of mussel larvae were determined in response to five mixed algal diets in which the relative contributions of C. calcitrans was varied over the experimental period (30 days). Fatty acid profiles of the larvae and algal diets were also assessed. The exclusion of C. calcitrans from the diet had no significant differences on larval growth and only minor differences in total fatty acid content were found between treatments. Fatty acid analysis revealed that larval survival was strongly influenced by the proportions of dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), while settlement was positively correlated with higher ratios of the n-3 long-chained polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LC-PUFA) (namely, DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA), to the n-6 LC-PUFA (arachidonic acid, ARA). Despite similar relative and absolute n-3 LC-PUFA levels in the larvae under different dietary treatments, the larvae receiving high levels of C. calcitrans performed significantly better in terms of survival and settlement success. These results indicate that the (DHA + EPA)/ARA ratio is a key factor in determining larval performance, rather than the total amount of these fatty acids.},

  Abstract                 = {The marine mussel \textit{Mytilus edulis} and its closely related sister species are distributed world-wide and play an important role in coastal ecology and economy. The diversification in different species and their hybrids, broad ecological distribution, as well as the filter feeding mode of life has made this genus an attractive model to investigate physiological and molecular adaptations and responses to various biotic and abiotic environmental factors. In the present study we investigated the immune system of Mytilus, which may contribute to the ecological plasticity of this species. We generated a large Mytilus transcriptome database from different tissues of immune challenged and stress treated individuals from the Baltic Sea using 454 pyrosequencing. Phylogenetic comparison of orthologous groups of 23 species demonstrated the basal position of lophotrochozoans within protostomes. The investigation of immune related transcripts revealed a complex repertoire of innate recognition receptors and downstream pathway members including transcripts for 27 toll-like receptors and 524 C1q domain containing transcripts. NOD-like receptors on the other hand were absent. We also found evidence for sophisticated TNF, autophagy and apoptosis systems as well as for cytokines. Gill tissue and hemocytes showed highest expression of putative immune related contigs and are promising tissues for further functional studies. Our results partly contrast with findings of a less complex immune repertoire in ecdysozoan and other lophotrochozoan protostomes. We show that bivalves are interesting candidates to investigate the evolution of the immune system from basal metazoans to deuterostomes and protostomes and provide a basis for future molecular work directed to immune system functioning in Mytilus.},

  Abstract                 = {Three enzyme systems, cyclooxygenases that generate prostaglandins, lipoxygenases that form hydroxy derivatives and leukotrienes, and epoxygenases that give rise to epoxyeicosatrienoic products, metabolize arachidonic acid after its release from neural membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipase A2. Lysophospholipids, the other products of phospholipase A2 reactions, are either reacylated or metabolized to platelet-activating factor. Under normal conditions, these metabolites play important roles in synaptic function, cerebral blood flow regulation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and gene expression. Increased activities of cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and epoxygenases under pathological situations such as ischemia, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease produce neuroinflammation involving vasodilation and vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, leukocyte chemotaxis and release of cytokines, and oxidative stress. These are closely associated with the neural cell injury which occurs in these neurological conditions. The metabolic products of docosahexaenoic acid, through these enzymes, generate a new class of lipid mediators, namely docosatrienes and resolvins. These metabolites antagonize the effect of metabolites derived from arachidonic acid. Recent studies provide insight into how these arachidonic acid metabolites interact with each other and other bioactive mediators such as platelet-activating factor, endocannabinoids, and docosatrienes under normal and pathological conditions. Here, we review present knowledge of the functions of cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and epoxygenases in brain and their association with neurodegenerative diseases.},

VEGF-A stimulation and Dll4/Notch signaling cooperatively control the number of new connections by regulating endothelial tip cell formation. Here, we show that the Notch-regulated ankyrin repeat protein (Nrarp) acts as a molecular link between Notch- and Lef1-dependent Wnt signaling in endothelial cells to control stability of new vessel connections in mouse and zebrafish. Dll4/Notch-induced expression of Nrarp limits Notch signaling and promotes Wnt/Ctnnb1 signaling in endothelial stalk cells through interactions with Lef1. BATgal-reporter expression confirms Wnt signaling activity in endothelial stalk cells. Ex vivo, combined Wnt3a and Dll4 stimulation of endothelial cells enhances Wnt-reporter activity, which is abrogated by loss of Nrarp. In vivo, loss of Nrarp, Lef1, or endothelial Ctnnb1 causes vessel regression. We suggest that the balance between Notch and Wnt signaling determines whether to make or break new vessel connections.},

  Abstract                 = {The presumption is that egg quality influences larval survival and that egg size influences egg quality. Thus, larger eggs should be favored by selection. Counterweighing the tendency for egg size to increase is the number of eggs that can be produced if egg size remains small. We examine how egg size and egg number counterbalance in Crassostrea oysters, resulting in an average egg size near 50 µm. Simulations imposing a diversity of ranges in larval survivorship—from little advantage for large eggs relative to small eggs to a great advantage—yield some anticipated outcomes in which genotypes generating larger eggs are favored. In other simulations, however, genotypes generating smaller eggs became increasingly common. In these cases, egg size declines, as does the likelihood of survival of individual larvae: the antithesis of expectation. Few simulations identify preferred egg sizes near the size typically observed, suggesting that, under most field conditions, a selective advantage exists for smaller or larger eggs than those typically spawned. However, the extremes in egg size are rarely advantageous. Most simulations resolve an optimal intermediate egg size. Thus, observed egg size is a balance between the chanciness of larval survival enhanced by the production of a larger number of eggs and the genetically predisposed, but environmentally modulated, individual probability of larval survival that is a function of egg size, with environment determining the optimal size. The 50-µm size observed likely represents the median outcome of a range of larval survivorship probabilities, each selecting for relatively larger or smaller eggs, imposed stochastically over multiple generations. In this scenario, each year the population is pulled toward smaller or larger egg sizes, but in the next year the impetus is independent of the previous year. Reduced generation time, by disease or fishing, modifies the extent, but not the direction of trend. Thus, environmental stochasticity retains preeminence in stabilizing a balance between the probabilities of survival modulated by egg number and by egg size. The influence of shortened generation time—by disease, for example—is unlikely to be manifest in a modification in egg size and hence egg number.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in RNA sequencing technology (RNA-Seq) enables comprehensive profiling of RNAs by producing millions of short sequence reads from size-fractionated RNA libraries. Although conventional tools for detecting and distinguishing non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) from reference-genome data can be applied to sequence data, ncRNA detection can be improved by harnessing the full information content provided by this new technology. Here we present NorahDesk, the first unbiased and universally applicable method for small ncRNAs detection from {RNA-seq} data. NorahDesk utilizes the coverage-distribution of small RNA sequence data as well as thermodynamic assessments of secondary structure to reliably predict and annotate ncRNA classes. Using publicly available mouse sequence data from brain, skeletal muscle, testis and ovary, we evaluated our method with an emphasis on the performance for microRNAs (miRNAs) and piwi-interacting small RNA (piRNA). We compared our method with Dario and mirDeep2 and found that NorahDesk produces longer transcripts with higher read coverage. This feature makes it the first method particularly suitable for the prediction of both known and novel piRNAs.},

Numerous processes are involved in reproduction leading to the production of offspring. Although diverse processes are involved in oogenesis (the production of eggs) and spermatogenesis (the production of sperm), the basic patterns of gametogenesis are similar amongst invertebrates, with the proliferation and differentiation of germ cells leading to the final production of mature gametes. The production of gametes, especially eggs, is energetically expensive, and therefore strongly sensitive to selective pressures. An organism can ingest and assimilate a limited amount of energy from the environment. The different ways by which energy is allocated to growth and reproduction in order to maximize fitness forms the basis of the differing life-history strategies that have developed in marine invertebrates.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental evidence shows that the hemocytes of Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamark have a multivalent receptor that responds to diverse agonists provoking the activation of the immune response. The same such agonists have the property of modulating the operability of the endocrine system. The relationship between the neuroendocrine and immune systems has led to the consideration of hemocytes as a mobile immune-brain. In Mytilus galloprovincialis, two protein kinases C (PKC) mediate these processes. According to their kinetic and regulatory properties, they were classified into the families of the Ca2+-independent PKCs (nPKC) and Ca2+-dependent PKCs (cPKC), and named after their molecular masses, p105 and p60, respectively. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induce catecholamine synthesis but display an agonist-specific picture. The particular responses of the diverse PKC isozymes may cause the differences. These results would agree with p60 acting only on dopamine synthesizing enzyme, whereas p105 would affect norepinephrine and epinephrine production. The action of IL-2 or PDGF is related to the regulation of mussel PKC activities through the induction of mechanisms of down-regulation and balancing of p105 phosphorylation levels. As proof of the stress response, the agonists assayed induce catecholamine synthesis faster than the immune response they provoke. Also, the seasonal behavior of both processes differs in time, which proves their different timings.},

  Abstract                 = {Estuarine crustaceans are often exposed to low dissolved O2 (hypoxia) accompanied by elevated CO2 (hypercapnia), which lowers water pH. Acclimatory responses to hypoxia have been widely characterized; responses to hypercapnia in combination with hypoxia (hypercapnic hypoxia) are less well known. Here we used oligonucleotide microar-rays to characterize changes in global gene expression in the hepato-pancreas of {Pacific} whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, exposed to hypoxia or hypercapnic hypoxia for 4 or 24 h, compared with time-matched animals held in air-saturated water (normoxia). Uni-genes whose expressions were significantly impacted by treatment and/or time were used to build artificial neural networks (ANNs) to identify genes with the greatest sensitivity in pairwise discriminations between treatments at each time point and between times for each treatment. ANN gene sets that discriminated hypoxia or hypercapnic hypoxia from normoxia shared functions of translation, mitochondrial energetics, and cellular defense. GO terms protein modification/ phosphorylation/cellular protein metabolism and RNA processing/ apoptosis/cell cycling occurred at highest frequency in discriminating hypercapnic hypoxia from hypoxia at 4 and 24 h, respectively. For 75.4% of the annotated ANN genes, exposure to hypercapnic hypoxia for 24 h reduced or reversed the transcriptional response to hypoxia alone. These results suggest that high CO2/low pH may interfere with transcriptionally based acclimation to hypoxia or elicit physiological or biochemical responses that relieve internal hypoxia. Whether these data reflect resilience or sensitivity of L. vannamei in the face of expanding hypoxic zones and rising levels of atmospheric CO2 may be important to understanding the survival of this and other estuarine species. © 2013 the {American} Physiological Society.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The striped bass and its relatives (genus Morone) are important fisheries and aquaculture species native to estuaries and rivers of the {Atlantic} coast and Gulf of Mexico in North America. To open avenues of gene expression research on reproduction and breeding of striped bass, we generated a collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a complementary {DNA }(cDNA) library representative of their ovarian transcriptome. Results: Sequences of a total of 230,151 ESTs (51,259,448 bp) were acquired by Roche 454 pyrosequencing of c{DNA }pooled from ovarian tissues obtained at all stages of oocyte growth, at ovulation (eggs), and during preovulatory atresia. Quality filtering of ESTs allowed assembly of 11,208 high-quality contigs 100 bp, including 2,984 contigs 500 bp or longer (average length 895 bp). Blastx comparisons revealed 5,482 gene orthologues (E-value < 10 -3), of which 4,120 (36.7% of total contigs) were annotated with Gene Ontology terms (E-value < 10 -6). There were 5,726 remaining unknown unique sequences (51.1% of total contigs). All of the high-quality EST sequences are available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Short Read Archive (GenBank: SRX007394). Informative contigs were considered to be abundant if they were assembled from groups of ESTs comprising 0.15% of the total short read sequences (345 reads/contig). Approximately 52.5% of these abundant contigs were predicted to have predominant ovary expression through digital differential display in silico comparisons to zebrafish (Danio rerio) UniGene orthologues. Over 1,300 Gene Ontology terms from Biological Process classes of Reproduction, Reproductive process, and Developmental process were assigned to this collection of annotated contigs. Conclusions: This first large reference sequence database available for the ecologically and economically important temperate basses (genus Morone) provides a foundation for gene expression studies in these species. The predicted predominance of ovary gene expression and assignment of directly relevant Gene Ontology classes suggests a powerful utility of this dataset for analysis of ovarian gene expression related to fundamental questions of oogenesis. Additionally, a high definition Agilent 60-mer oligo ovary 'UniClone' microarray with 8 × 15,000 probe format has been designed based on this striped bass transcriptome (eArray Group: Striper Group, Design ID: 029004). © 2012 Reading et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Modulated modularity clustering was used to group co-variable proteins into expression modules and Gene Ontology (GO) biological process and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were conducted for proteins within those modules. We discovered that components of the ribosome along with translation initiation and elongation factors generally decrease as the annual ovarian cycle progresses toward ovulation, concomitant with a slight increase in components of the 26S-proteasome. Co-variation within more than one expression module of components from these two multi-protein complexes suggests that they are not only co-regulated, but that co-regulation occurs through more than one sub-network. These components also co-vary with subunits of the TCP-1 chaperonin system and enzymes of intermediary metabolic pathways, suggesting that protein folding and cellular bioenergetic state play important roles in protein synthesis and degradation. We provide further evidence to suggest that protein synthesis and degradation are intimately linked, and our results support function of a proteasome-ribosome supercomplex known as the translasome. © 2013 {American} Chemical Society.},

The HcToll1 protein consisted of a signal peptide, 17 LRR domains, 2 LRRCT domains, 1 LRRNT domain, 1 TM domain, and 1 TIR domain. Phylogenetic analysis results showed that HcToll1 was clustered in one group together with other mollusca tolls. RT-PCR analysis results showed that HcToll1 was expressed in all tested tissues such as hemocytes, hepatopancreas, gills, and mantle. qRT-PCR analysis results showed that HcToll1 expression was increased by the presence of Escherichia coli, Vibrio anguillarum, Staphyloccocus aureus, and White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV). Over-expression of HcTIR could up-regulate expression of drosomycin gene in Drosophila S2 cells. The results of our study indicated that HcToll1 is a functional Toll and it has an important function in the generation of innate immune responses of H. cumingii against microbial challenge.},

The AVNV genome is a linear, double-stranded {DNA }molecule of 210,993 bp with a nucleotide composition of 38.5% G + C. A total of 123 open reading frames were predicted to encode functional proteins, ranging from 41 to 1,878 amino acid residues. The {DNA }sequence of AVNV is 97% identical to that of ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1), and the amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins of these two viruses are 94-100% identical. The genomic organization of AVNV is similar to that of OsHV-1, and consists of two unique regions (170.4 kb and 3.4 kb, respectively), each flanked by two inverted repeats (7.6 kb and 10.2 kb, respectively), with a third unique region (1.5 kb) situated between the two internal repeats. Conclusions
Our results indicate that AVNV is a variant of OsHV-1. The AVNV genome sequence provides information useful for understanding the evolution and divergence of OsHV-1 in marine molluscs.},

  Abstract                 = {Repertoires of proteins and small peptides play numerous physiological roles as hormones, antimicrobial peptides, and cellular signaling factors. The beta-thymosins are a group of small acidic peptides involved in processes such as actin sequestration, neuronal development, wound healing, tissue repair, and angiogenesis. Recent characterization of the beta thymosins as immunological regulators in invertebrates led to our identification and characterization of a beta-thymosin homologue (T?) from Haliotis discus discus. The c{DNA }possessed an ORF of 132. bp encoding a protein of 44 amino acids with a molecular mass of 4977. Da. The amino acid sequence shows high identity with another molluskan beta-thymosin and has a characteristic actin binding motif (LKKTET) and glutamyl donors. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with molluskan homologues, as well as its distinct identity and common ancestral origin. Genomic analysis revealed a 3 exon-2 intron structure similar to the other homologues. In silico promoter analysis also revealed significant transcription factor binding sites, providing evidence for the expression of this gene under different cellular conditions, including stress or pathogenic attack. Tissue distribution profiling revealed a ubiquitous presence in all the examined tissues, but with the highest expression in mantle and hemocyte. Immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide, poly I:C and Vibrio parahemolyticus induced beta-thymosin expression in gill and hemocytes, affirming an immune-related role in invertebrates. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {Introduction: Traditionally, genomic or transcriptomic data have been restricted to a few model or emerging model organisms, and to a handful of species of medical and/or environmental importance. Next-generation sequencing techniques have the capability of yielding massive amounts of gene sequence data for virtually any species at a modest cost. Here we provide a comparative analysis of de novo assembled transcriptomic data for ten non-model species of previously understudied animal taxa. Results: c{DNA }libraries of ten species belonging to five animal phyla (2 Annelida [including Sipuncula], 2 Arthropoda, 2 Mollusca, 2 Nemertea, and 2 Porifera) were sequenced in different batches with an Illumina Genome Analyzer II (read length 100 or 150 bp), rendering between ca . 25 and 52 million reads per species. Read thinning, trimming, and de novo assembly were performed under different parameters to optimize output. Between 67,423 and 207,559 contigs were obtained across the ten species, post-optimization. Of those, 9,069 to 25,681 contigs retrieved blast hits against the NCBI non-redundant database, and approximately 50% of these were assigned with Gene Ontology terms, covering all major categories, and with similar percentages in all species. Local blasts against our datasets, using selected genes from major signaling pathways and housekeeping genes, revealed high efficiency in gene recovery compared to available genomes of closely related species. Intriguingly, our transcriptomic datasets detected multiple paralogues in all phyla and in nearly all gene pathways, including housekeeping genes that are traditionally used in phylogenetic applications for their purported single-copy nature. We generated the first study of comparative transcriptomics across multiple animal phyla (comparing two species per phylum in most cases), established the first Illumina-based transcriptomic datasets for sponge, nemertean, and sipunculan species, and generated a tractable catalogue of annotated genes (or gene fragments) and protein families for ten newly sequenced non-model organisms, some of commercial importance (i.e., Octopus vulgaris ). These comprehensive sets of genes can be readily used for phylogenetic analysis, gene expression profiling, developmental analysis, and can also be a powerful resource for gene discovery. The characterization of the transcriptomes of such a diverse array of animal species permitted the comparison of sequencing depth, functional annotation, and efficiency of genomic sampling using the same pipelines, which proved to be similar for all considered species. In addition, the datasets revealed their potential as a resource for paralogue detection, a recurrent concern in various aspects of biological inquiry, including phylogenetics, molecular evolution, development, and cellular biochemistry.},

Although they do not seem to be true or primive ficolins since the phylogenetic analysis are not conclusive enough, their expression is increased after bacterial infection or PAMPs treatment and they present opsonic activities similar to mammalian ficolins. The most remarkable aspect of these sequences was the existence of a very diverse set of FREP sequences among and within individuals (different mussels do not share any identical sequence) which parallels the extraordinary complexity of the immune system, suggesting the existence of a primitive system with a potential capacity to recognize and eliminate different kind of pathogens.},

  Abstract                 = {Diseases are a critical bottleneck for the culture of bivalves causing important yield losses. The study of bivalve diseases has relied on histological techniques and has focused on pathogen morphology, the effect of external factors on the pathogens and infectivity, and on the development of immune and molecular diagnostic techniques. Recently, significant advances inthe study of bivalve pathology have been reported; however, increased efforts using “omics tools” are required to explain key physiological/immunological processes. Transcriptomic analysis in parallel with detailed functional studies of gene expression and cell biology in \textit{in vitro}and \textit{in vivo}experimental models are needed. Another important factor is the identification of “resistance traits” and a deeper understanding of the processes that contribute to the welfare of bivalves in culture. Additionally, the definition of "abnormal mortalities" is critical for managing and legislating bivalve aquaculture. The new technologies clearly “opens the door” for the directed manipulation of bivalves to improve the modern intensive aquaculture systems. The future of bivalve research is exciting, and there is an obvious need to develop multidisciplinary international research studies involving research groups and growers organisations to work on shellfish pathology},

  Abstract                 = {ERK1 and ERK2 are related protein-serine/threonine kinases that participate in the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signal transduction cascade. This cascade participates in the regulation of a large variety of processes including cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, cell migration, cell survival, differentiation, metabolism, proliferation, and transcription. MEK1/2 catalyze the phosphorylation of human ERK1/2 at Tyr204/187 and then Thr202/185. The phosphorylation of both tyrosine and threonine is required for enzyme activation. Whereas the Raf kinase and MEK families have narrow substrate specificity, ERK1/2 catalyze the phosphorylation of hundreds of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates including regulatory molecules and transcription factors. ERK1/2 are proline-directed kinases that preferentially catalyze the phosphorylation of substrates containing a Pro-Xxx-Ser/Thr-Pro sequence. Besides this primary structure requirement, many ERK1/2 substrates possess a D-docking site, an F-docking site, or both. A variety of scaffold proteins including KSR1/2, IQGAP1, MP1, ?-Arrestin1/2 participate in the regulation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase cascade. The regulatory dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 is mediated by protein-tyrosine specific phosphatases, protein-serine/threonine phosphatases, and dual specificity phosphatases. The combination of kinases and phosphatases make the overall process reversible. The ERK1/2 catalyzed phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factors including those of Ets, Elk, and c-Fos represents an important function and requires the translocation of ERK1/2 into the nucleus by active and passive processes involving the nuclear pore. These transcription factors participate in the immediate early gene response. The activity of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade is increased in about one-third of all human cancers, and inhibition of components of this cascade by targeted inhibitors represents an important anti-tumor strategy. Thus far, however, only inhibition of mutant B-Raf (Val600Glu) has been found to be therapeutically efficacious.},

  Abstract                 = {Planktonic marine invertebrate embryos and larvae lead transitory lives of great risk and grave uncertainty. Estimation of the magnitude of risk and mortality, however presents a formidable challenge. Three methods are currently in use to estimate levels of mortality among populations of marine invertebrate larvae: 1) theoretical models where rates of instantaneous mortality are correlated with other life history parameters, 2) estimation of mortality based on laboratory observations of predator-prey interactions and 3) analysis of relationships among gamete production, larval populations, and densities of post-larvae in the field. Theoretical exercises indicate that rates of larval mortality are correlated with duration of the planktonic period, and that differences in mortality rates may be offset by differences in egg size and fecundity. Results from laboratory investigations suggest that mortality rates change with larval size or age. Attempts to monitor cohorts of larvae in the plankton offer the most direct evidence for natural mortality, although they often lack confidence that larvae were sampled from a continuous population. Because factors that contribute to the mortality of marine invertebrate embryos and larvae operate concurrently and mortality is a density-dependent and age-specific demographic process, detailed investigations of several synergistic ecological parameters are required to provide meaningful estimates of instantaneous mortality rates in larval populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on the microalgae Isochrysis galbana clone T-iso (Ti), Chaetoceros gracilis (Cg) and Tetraselmis suecica (Ts), in the present investigation 8 different feeding regimes were trialed for Mytilus galloprovincialis larval culture: starvation, 3 monospecific diets (Ti; Cg; Ts), 3 bispecific diets (Ti + Cg; Ti + Ts; Cg + Ts) and the trispecific diet Ti + Cg + Ts. The effect of these feeding regimes on several culture parameters (survival, growth, development, competency and settlement) was assessed, and total lipid and fatty acid composition of larvae were analyzed. Our results revealed that specimens were not able to feed on Ts during their earliest development phases, and cultures deprived of ingestible food showed signs of starvation at 8–9 days post fertilization. The diets Ti + Cg, Cg + Ts and Ti + Cg + Ts showed better results than the rest in one or more culture parameters. Although the presence of Cg in a mixed diet seemed to be advantageous, the monospecific diet Cg entailed unexpected larval crushes as well as competency and settlement impairments. The comparative analysis of fatty acid compositions of larvae and diets provided showed that: (i) larvae have a certain capacity for fatty acid regulation, including some de novo biosynthesis; (ii) larvae seem to gain new synthesis capacities with metamorphosis, and (iii) the lack of some polyunsaturated fatty acids (especially docosahexaenoic acid), together with excessive levels of arachidonic acid, might have caused the poor results obtained with the monospecific diet Cg.},

Lipid was the main biochemical fraction among egg reserves (counting ca. 80%), and the embryonic activities were fueled by stored triglycerides and esters. Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) 22:6n3 played a structural role during embryonic development, while monounsaturated fatty acids and other PUFA seemed to be preferentially catabolyzed (e.g. 20:5n3, 18:2n6 or 18:3n3). In the transition from D-shaped to pediveliger larva, all the biochemical fractions increased as nutrients were incorporated exogenously from diet. Non methylene interrupted dienoic fatty acid (NMID) levels were similar to those of some essential fatty acids during development. Lipid fraction increased in postlarvae with respect to pediveliger larvae, and no significant energy losses were detected with metamorphosis. Our results provide useful information for the successful hatchery production of M. galloprovincialis.},

Quantitative as well as qualitative results showed that late post-monsoon (April–May) and pre-monsoon (June–September) periods were found to be suitable periods for larval growth, development, and survival to adult stages for most of the organisms. Clustering of physico-chemical and biological (including larval and adult availability) data yielded two major clusters; one formed by northeast (NE) monsoon months (October–January) and the other by post-monsoon/summer (February–May) months, whereas; pre-monsoon months (June–September) were distributed between these two clusters. Among all the major macrofouler groups, only bivalves established a successful relationship between its larval abundance and adult settlement. Principal component analysis indicated good associations of bivalve larvae with polychaete larvae and adult bivalves with adult barnacles. However, biotic relation between ascidians and bryozoans was observed both in the larval as well as adult community.},

  Abstract                 = {French oyster farming has been subject to severe mortalities during the summer months. Results from the research program “Morest”, which ran from 2000 to 2006 and examined the possible causes of these mortalities, led to the construction of a model to explain the interaction between environmental factors, oyster physiology and different opportunistic pathogens underlying oyster summer mortality. Temperature, food, reproduction and stress were the main factors required for oyster mortality. Genetically-based resistance (“R” oysters) or susceptibility (“S” oysters) to summer mortality was revealed by divergent selection. Building on these results, a literature search was made in 2007 on the molecular origin of genetic resistance to such a complex mortality risk. The objectives were to lay a foundation for the preparation and orientation of future research directions and to improve understanding of the underlying physiological mechanism leading to summer mortality. Three years later, the resulting conceptual analysis reported here was presented as an introductory lecture to Physiomar 2010, a conference where many new results contributing to this research field were also reported. The literature review highlighted two major review articles: the first dealing with nutrition and reproduction (Schneider 2004), the second with reproduction, temperature, oxidative stress and mortality (Heineinger 2002). The effect of nutrition level on energy orientation to growth or reproduction is controlled by endocrine factors. Among these, neuropeptide Y (NPY), ghrelin and leptin neuropeptides appeared to be potential candidates involved in germ-soma orientation in relation to trophic conditions. Depending on reproductive effort and temperature, a metabolic stress resulting from the germ-soma conflict can appear, characterized by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Such an excess of ROS induces perturbations in mitochondrial activity leading to cell death. Many organisms, such as annual plants or the {Pacific} salmon, do not survive their first reproduction. In contrast, others increase stress resistance by selection of antioxidant processes (superoxide dismutase SOD, catalase, etc.) through evolution, and survive first reproduction. A similar difference was observed in the comparison made between R and S oysters, which differed in ROS production, SOD and catalase levels. Such factors controlling reproduction and ROS detoxification processes could therefore provide new markers for selection of oysters with better resistance to non-specific pathogens, complementing other classic selection approaches against specific pathogens or for improved immunity. This antioxidant defence mechanism is found in many organisms including vertebrates and in some invertebrates, including oysters. Its role needs to be considered in pathology events involving other aquaculture species and it may also contribute to explaining the increase in marine pathologies under anthropogenic environmental changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence suggests that members of the oyster genus Crassostrea share a common haemolymphprotein. Cavortin, the major haemolymph protein of the {Pacific} oyster (Crassostrea gigas), comprises 174 amino acid residues totalling 19.4 kDa and is rich in histidine and aspartic acid. The protein consists of a single Cu/Zn SOD (superoxide dismutase) derived domain showing homology to each of the three SOD?like domains of pernin, the related 60 kDa protein from the green?lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus). Despite some homology to Cu/Zn SOD sequences we found no compelling evidence that it has retained SOD function. Cavortin has affinity for several divalent cations, particularly iron. Each cavortin monomer is able to bind 8–11 iron ions, but can sequester considerably more iron, presumably by forming spheroid particles. The primary function of cavortin, like pernin, has been altered during the course of evolution, but has yet to be determined unambiguously. A likely role is as a metal ion chaperone.},

It showed strongest activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Staphylococcus aureus; minimum effective concentrations [MECs] 2.4 and 3.0 ?g/ml, respectively) but also had significant activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli D31 and Vibrio parahemolyticus; MECs 7.6 and 15.0 ?g/ml, respectively). Comparison of the amino acid sequence with those of other known antimicrobial peptides revealed that the novel peptide had high sequence homology to arthropod defensins, including those from other bivalves, the mussels \textit{Mytilus edulis} and \textit{Mytilus galloprovincialis}.

These techniques are operated for the survival of prawn larvae (from eggs to post larvae) on the water quality; the effect of stocking density on survival of the post larvae; and economical aspects of the three culture techniques. The three larvi culture techniques studied were: (1) the Clear water system with partial changes of water, (2) the green water system with a separate sub sand filter out side of the tank and (3) the green water system with a closed recirculation water system with a sub sand filter inside rearing tank. The results showed that the mean productions of metamorphosed post larvae prawn per liter of water in the three systems were compared. Fluctuations in the production of post larvae were greater in the clear water system than in the other two types of closed system. During the course of trails in the clear system, the ammonia level was intermittently high and might have caused high larval mortality.}

  Abstract                 = {Pearl oyster, Pinctada martensii, is a marine bivalve species widely distributed in tropic and subtropic marine coasts. Mantle is the special tissue of P. martensii that secretes biomineralization proteins inducing shell deposition as well as iridescent nacre both in the inner shell and artificial nucleus. The pearl oyster is very efficient for artificial pearl production and is therefore an ideal organism for studies into the processes of biomineralization. However, deficiency of transcriptome information limits the insight into biomineralization mechanisms and pearl formation. In this study, we sequenced and characterized the P. martensii mantle transcriptome using 454 pyrosequencing. A total of 25,723 unique transcripts were assembled from 220,824 quality reads, followed by annotation and Gene Ontology classification analysis. A total of 146 unique transcript segments homologous to 49 reference biomineralization genes were identified, including calcineurin-binding protein, amorphous calcium carbonate binding protein 1, calmodulin, calponin-like protein, carbonic anhydrase 1, glycine-rich shell matrix protein, lysine-rich matrix protein, mantle gene or protein, nacrein, pearlin, PIF, regucalcin, and shematrin. The sequence data enabled the identification of 10,285 potential single nucleotide polymorphism loci and 7,836 putative indels, providing a resource for molecular biomarker, population genetics, and functional genomic studies. A large number of candidate genes for biomineralization were identified, considerably enriching resources for the study of shell formation. These sequence data will notably advance biomineralization and transcriptome study in pearl oyster and other Pinctada species.},

Access to parallel, massive amounts of sequencing data, as well as subsequent improvements in read length and throughput of different sequencing platforms, is leading to a better representation of sample diversity at a reasonable cost. New technologies are being developed rapidly and have the potential to dramatically accelerate ecological and environmental research.

Especially in estuaries, habitats that are of particular concern, environmental variables, such as salinity, can vary significantly. Although hinted at in the literature, there is a lack of clarification as to whether changes in salinity or emersion-induced hypoxia have the potential to alter background {DNA }damage in mussels, thus masking the extent of potential genotoxic effects following exposure to environmental contaminants. The present study exposed \textit{Mytilus edulis} in the laboratory to static salinities (25, 50, 75, and 100 %) for 72 h. Mussels were also subjected to simulated tidal cycles, including periods of emersion, for 72 h. None of these treatments resulted in a significant change in the level of {DNA }damage expressed as % tail DNA. These experiments demonstrate that salinity, within the limits of the concentrations tested, and temporary emersion are not confounding factors for Comet assay data derived from M. edulis.},

  Abstract                 = {Microglia are activated in response to a number of different pathological states within the CNS including injury, ischemia, and infection. Microglial activation results in their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-?. While release of these factors is typically intended to prevent further damage to CNS tissue, they may also be toxic to neurons and other glial cells. Mounting evidence indicates that chronic microglial activation may also contribute to the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Unfortunately, determining the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in these disorders has been complicated by their dual roles in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. The purpose of this review is to summarize current understanding of the involvement of cytokines in neurodegenerative disorders and their potential signaling mechanisms in this context. Taken together, recent findings suggest that microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines merit interest as targets in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter describes prostanoids and explains the cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and epoxygenase pathways. Prostanoids, which include the prostaglandins and thromboxanes are formed by the action of cyclooxygenases and have their aliphatic side chains emanating from C-8 and C-12 of the cyclopentane ring. Leukotrienes are produced by the action of 5-1ipoxygenase (5-LO), and the biosynthesis of leukotrienes within cells is highly regulated and depends not only on the availability of arachidonic acid and molecular oxygen, but also on the subcellular location of 5-LO. The conversion of leukotrienes into alternative structural entities is an important feature of inactivation of these potent biologically active eicosanoids. Numerous lipoxygenases occur within the plant and animal kingdoms; however, the overall biological activities of the lipoxygenase products are not completely known. The currently known biological actions of leukotrienes all involve cell membrane G-protein-linked receptors, yet an understanding of why biosynthesis of these lipophilic molecules occurs deep within the cell remains a mystery. Thus, considerable challenges remain in understanding the detailed biochemistry involved in the synthesis and release of biologically active leukotrienes.},

  Abstract                 = {Integrating the effects of multiple stressors and predicting their consequences for the species’ survival and distribution is an important problem in ecological physiology. This review applies the concept of energy-limited tolerance to stress to develop bioenergetic markers that can assist in integrating the effects of multiple stressors and distinguishing between the moderate stress compatible with long-term survival of populations and bioenergetically unsustainable extreme stress. These markers reflect the progressive decline of the aerobic scope of an organism (defined as the fraction of the energy flux and metabolic power supporting this flux available after the basal maintenance costs of an organism are met) with increasing levels of the environmental stress. During the exposure to moderate stress (i.e., in the pejus range of the environmental conditions), the aerobic scope is positive but reduced compared with the optimum conditions. The reduction of the metabolic scope can be due to the (1) elevated costs of basal metabolism, (2) activation of the mechanisms for protection and damage repair, (3) reduced assimilation of food, and/or (4) stress-induced impacts on the aerobic pathways producing ATP. This leads to suboptimal growth and reproductive rates in the pejus range of environmental conditions and is commonly observed in food-limited and energy-limited wild populations. The tolerance windows of the organisms are delimited by the pessimum range(s) of environmental conditions in which the aerobic scope of the organism disappears (so that all available energy and metabolic capacity are used in support of basal metabolism), energy resources are depleted, and partial anaerobiosis and/or metabolic rate depression set in. The habitats where environmental conditions remain in the pessimum zone long enough to prevent consistent growth and reproduction often coincide with the species’ distributional limits. Thus, focus on the bioenergetic effects of environmental stressors and their immediate consequences for fitness provides a suitable framework for integrating physiology and functional ecology and can assist in understanding the driving forces and limitations of environmental adaptation and improving assessment of ecological risk as well as environmental management in field populations facing multiple stressors.},

  Abstract                 = {Finding genes that are differentially expressed between conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In the past decades, {DNA }microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of c{DNA }(RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is conceivable that the use of {RNA-seq} for differential expression analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have been developed especially for differential expression analysis of {RNA-seq} data. Results
We conducted an extensive comparison of eleven methods for differential expression analysis of {RNA-seq} data. All methods are freely available within the R framework and take as input a matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature of interest in each of a number of samples. We evaluate the methods based on both simulated data and real {RNA-seq} data. Conclusions
Very small sample sizes, which are still common in {RNA-seq} experiments, impose problems for all evaluated methods and any results obtained under such conditions should be interpreted with caution. For larger sample sizes, the methods combining a variance-stabilizing transformation with the ‘limma’ method for differential expression analysis perform well under many different conditions, as does the nonparametric SAMseq method},

Inan effort to identify scallop genes involved in host defense, a high-quality c{DNA }library was constructed from whole body tissues of the bay scallop. A total of 5828 successful sequencing reactions yielded 4995 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) longer than 100 bp. Cluster and assembly analyses of the ESTs identified 637 contigs (consisting of 2853 sequences) and 2142 singletons, totaling 2779 unique sequences. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis showed that the majority (73%) of the unique sequences had no significant homology (E-value ? 0.005) to sequences in GenBank. Among the 748 sequences with significant GenBank matches, 160 (21.4%) were for genes related to metabolism, 131 (17.5%) for cell/organism defense, 124 (16.6%) for gene/protein expression, 83 (11.1%) for cell structure/motility, 70 (9.4%) for cell signaling/communication, 17 (2.3%) for cell division, and 163 (21.8%) matched to genes of unknown functions. The list of host-defense genes included many genes with known and important roles in innate defense such as lectins, defensins, proteases, protease inhibitors, heat shock proteins, antioxidants, and Toll-like receptors. The study provides a significant number of ESTs for gene discovery and candidate genes for studying host defense in scallops and other molluscs.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding how parasites inflict fitness costs on their hosts is a key question in host–parasite biology. Rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus) are small cyprinid fish that place their eggs in the gills of living freshwater mussels. The embryos complete their development inside the mussel gill and emerge as free-swimming larvae after approximately 4 weeks. Bitterling show a range of specialized adaptations for using mussels as a spawning substrate, and the presence of bitterling embryos has been shown to retard the growth of mussels. We compared the development and survival of embryos incubated in either mussels or Petri dishes and exposed to either nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor pond water. Embryonic development rate was significantly faster in Petri dishes, probably as a result of oxygen limitation in mussel gills. Embryo survival rate was significantly higher in nutrient-rich than filtered water, suggesting that the embryos obtained a nutritional benefit prior to emergence from the host. The results imply that bitterling embryos compete for oxygen and nutrients with their host mussel, as well as each other, and in this way, impose a growth cost on mussels.},

  Abstract                 = {Prostaglandins and other eicosanoids are oxygenated metabolites of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids. These compounds are well known for their important actions in mammalian physiology and disease. Recent work has revealed the presence and biological actions of eicosanoids in insects and many other invertebrate animals. In insects, eicosanoids mediate cellular immunity to microbial and metazoan challenge. Notably, some infectious organisms secrete factors responsible for impairing host insect immune reactions by inhibiting biosynthesis of eicosanoids. Eicosanoids also act in insect reproductive biology, in ion transport physiology, and in fever response to infection as well as in protein exocytosis in tick salivary glands. Aside from ongoing actions in homeostasis, certain eicosanoid actions occur at crucial points in insect life histories, such as during infectious challenge and important events in reproduction.},

  Abstract                 = {Insects express 3 lines of protection from infections and invasions. Their cuticles and peritrophic membranes are physical barriers. Infections and invasions are quickly recognized within insect bodies, and recognition launches 2 lines of innate immune reactions. Humoral reactions involve induced synthesis of antimicrobial peptides, the bacteriolytic enzyme lysozyme and activation of the prophenoloxidase system. Cellular immune reactions include phagocytosis, nodulation and encapsulation. These reactions entail direct interactions between circulating hemocytes and the invaders. Cellular immune reactions begin immediately after an invasion is detected while antimicrobial peptides typically appear in the hemolymph some hours after infection. Microaggregation is a step in the nodulation process, which is responsible for clearing the bulk of bacterial infections from circulation. Coordinated cellular actions lead to encapsulation of invaders, such as parasitoid eggs, that are very much larger than individual hemocytes. In this paper, we review the roles of eicosanoids as central mediators of insect immune reactions, particularly cellular reactions. We briefly describe insect immune functions, outline eicosanoid biosynthesis and treat eicosanoid actions in cellular immunity of insects. Eicosanoids act in several cellular defense functions, including phagocytosis, microaggregation, nodulation, encapsulation, cell spreading and hemocyte migration toward a source of a bacterial peptide. We also describe our most recent work on the influence of one group of eicosanoids, prostaglandins, on gene expression in an established insect cell line.},

The aim of this review is to first briefly summarise how next generation sequencing (NGS) has transformed our ability to identify the genes underpinning adaptation. We then demonstrate how the application of these genomic tools to ecological model species means that we can start addressing some of the questions that have puzzled ecological geneticists for decades such as: How many genes are involved in adaptation? What types of genetic variation are responsible for adaptation? Does adaptation utilise pre-existing genetic variation or does it require new mutations to arise following an environmental change?},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, the advent of high-throughput assays, coupled with their diminishing cost, has facilitated a systems approach to biology. As a consequence, massive amounts of data are currently being generated, requiring efficient methodology aimed at the reduction of scale. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling is a standard component of systems-level analyses, and to reduce scale and improve inference clustering genes is common. Since clustering is often the first step toward generating hypotheses, cluster quality is critical. Conversely, because the validation of cluster-driven hypotheses is indirect, it is critical that quality clusters not be obtained by subjective means. In this paper, we present a new objective-based clustering method and demonstrate that it yields high-quality results. Our method, modulated modularity clustering (MMC), seeks community structure in graphical data. MMC modulates the connection strengths of edges in a weighted graph to maximize an objective function (called modularity) that quantifies community structure. The result of this maximization is a clustering through which tightly-connected groups of vertices emerge. Our application is to systems genetics, and we quantitatively compare MMC both to the hierarchical clustering method most commonly employed and to three popular spectral clustering approaches. We further validate MMC through analyses of human and Drosophila melanogaster expression data, demonstrating that the clusters we obtain are biologically meaningful. We show MMC to be effective and suitable to applications of large scale. In light of these features, we advocate MMC as a standard tool for exploration and hypothesis generation.},

  Abstract                 = {Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) specifically binds to peptidoglycan and plays a crucial role in the innate immune responses as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR). The c{DNA }of a short type PGRP was cloned from scallop \textit{Chlamys farreri} (named CfPGRP-S1) by homology cloning with degenerate primers, and confirmed by virtual Northern blots. The full length of CfPGRP-S1 c{DNA }was 1073 bp in length, including a 5? untranslated region (UTR) of 59 bp, a 3? UTR of 255 bp, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 759 bp encoding a polypeptide of 252 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 27.88 kDa and a predicted isoelectric point of 8.69. BLAST analysis revealed that CfPGRP-S1 shared high identities with other known PGRPs. A conserved PGRP domain and three zinc-binding sites were present at its C-terminus. The temporal expression of CfPGRP-S1 gene in healthy, Vibrio anguillarum-challenged and Micrococcus lysodeikticus-challenged scallops was measured by RT-PCR analysis. The expression of CfPGRP-S1 was upregulated initially in the first 12 h or 24 h either by M. lysodeikticus or V. anguillarum challenge and reached the maximum level at 24 h or 36 h, then dropped progressively, and recovered to the original level as the stimulation decreased at 72 h. There was no significant difference between V. anguillarum and M. lysodeikticus challenge. The results indicated that the CfPGRP-S1 was a constitutive and inducible acute-phase protein which was involved in the immune response against bacterial infection.},

These factors represent serious challenges to a multitude of estuarine organisms as well as to efforts to restore depleted stocks of filter-feeding bivalves. In this study, we compared the responses of larval bivalves \textit{Crassostrea virginica} and Argopecten irradians to the brown tide alga Aureococcus anophagefferens (250 × 106 cells l?1 and 1 × 109 cells l?1, respectively) and a gradient of CO2 concentrations (~240, ~390, and ~850 ppm). Results indicated that A. anophagefferens and higher levels of CO2 significantly depressed rates of survival, development, growth, and lipid synthesis of A. irradians larvae with the combination of both factors having the largest effects. C. virginica larvae were also negatively impacted by the harmful alga and elevated CO2, but displayed a higher overall survival rate when exposed to these combined stressors. For both species, high densities of A. anophagefferens (109 cells l?1) elicited a stronger negative effect on larval survival than high levels of CO2 concentrations (~850 ppm). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the concurrent occurrence of harmful algal blooms and high CO2 concentrations will have negative consequences for bivalve populations and further demonstrate that some species of larval bivalves are more resistant to these stressors than others.}

To understand the response of these two oysters to parasite exposure, a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) method was employed to characterize genes up-regulated during parasite challenge in both hemocytes and gills. The number of differentially expressed gene sequences obtained was 107 for C. virginica and 69 for C. gigas, including 46 and 37 sequences, respectively, that matched known genes in GenBank. Most of the sequences have not been characterized in other molluscs. Nineteen genes involved in immune system and cell communication, protein regulation and transcription, cell cycle, respiratory chain and cytoskeleton were selected for expression analysis by semi-quantitative PCR. Although varying in magnitude and timing post exposure, all genes screened showed over-expression in challenged oysters in both species, validating the SSH method. Results of this study highlighted some differences in gene expression between the two oysters in response to P. marinus infection, providing candidate genes and pathways for further analysis.},

Our data showed that hemocytes could have a discriminative capacity towards microorganisms. Both V. splendidus LGP32 strains had an effect on hemocyte adhesion, phagocytosis abilities and oxidative burst, whereas the environmental strain 7SHRW induced weak and delayed hemocyte responses. At a molecular level, differential levels of candidate transcripts were measured in M. edulis hemocytes exposed to V. splendidus LGP32-GFP and 7SHRW. Mainly, a down-regulation of defensin was recorded in hemocytes exposed to V. splendidus LGP32. A significant up-regulation of lysozyme and proteasome 26S was observed at 2 h followed by a down-regulation at 4 and 6 h of exposure to the LGP32 strain. Similarly, SOD and GPx genes were up-regulated 2 h post-exposure to LGP32 strain and their expressions decreased after 4 and 6 h post-exposure. Further analysis is however needed in a near future to relate the transcript level variations with the physiological process.},

  Abstract                 = {Molluscan defense mechanisms are regulated to innate immunity, which is largely dependent on cellular components such as hemocytes possessing phagocytic and bactericidal activities. Among immune responses, apoptosis is an indispensable process because it enables the adequate clearance of damaged, senescent and infected cells without inflammation. Available information related to the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis has been accumulated for many molluscan species during the last decade. Almost all molluscan species live in an environment that changes incessantly according to microorganisms, industrial pollutants, temperature, and salinity. Such environmental factors might directly or indirectly induce apoptosis in molluscan cells. One type of apoptotic agent, reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), which are produced by a stress signal or phagocytosis, triggers apoptotic cell death in molluscan hemocytes. Dysfunction of ROI-mediated hemocytic apoptosis putatively causes disease morbidity and/or mortality when molluscan organisms are infected by pathogens. Furthermore, integrins have attracted attention for their unique functions because integrins regulate the phagocytic ability of molluscan hemocytes and induce hemocytic apoptosis. That process might be the result of ROI-generation. In this review, we summarize the roles and molecular mechanisms of apoptosis related to immunological functions of molluscan hemocytes.},

Effects of low pH (7.9, 7.6, 7.4) on the early growth phase of Portuguese oyster (Crassostrea angulata) veliger larvae was examined at ambient salinity (34 ppt) and the low-salinity (27 ppt) treatment. Additionally, the combined effect of pH (8.1, 7.6), salinity (24 and 34 ppt) and temperature (24 °C and 30 °C) was examined using factorial experimental design. Surprisingly, the early growth phase from hatching to 5-day-old veliger stage showed high tolerance to pH 7.9 and pH 7.6 at both 34 ppt and 27 ppt. Larval shell area was significantly smaller at pH 7.4 only in low-salinity. In the 3-factor experiment, shell area was affected by salinity and the interaction between salinity and temperature but not by other combinations. Larvae produced the largest shell at the elevated temperature in low-salinity, regardless of pH. Thus the growth of the Portuguese oyster larvae appears to be robust to near-future pH level (> 7.6) when combined with projected elevated temperature and low-salinity in the coastal aquaculture zones of South China Sea.},

  Abstract                 = {Physical and biological conditions impact recruitment and adult population structure of marine invertebrates by affecting early life-history processes from spawning to post-settlement. We investigated how temperature, salinity, and phytoplankton influenced larval abundance and larval size structure for 3 species of bivalves over 2 non-consecutive years in Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, USA. Abundance and size of Mercenaria mercenaria (quahog), Anomia simplex (jingle clam), and Geukensia demissa (ribbed mussel) larvae were compared between locations in the bay and with environmental conditions. Shell birefringence patterns using polarized light microscopy were used to distinguish species. Larval abundances for all 3 species were higher in 2009 than in 2007 and were positively correlated with temperature in both years. Differences in larval abundance and size structure between bay sites were attributed to salinity tolerances and potential source locations. Higher survival in 2009 than in 2007, as determined by number of pediveligers, was likely due to higher temperatures and greater food availability during the peak abundance months of July and August in 2009. Yearly differences in larval growth and survival can have a large impact on recruitment. Knowing the optimal periods and locations for larval abundance and survival can be useful for isolating species-specific patterns in larval dispersal and to aid resource managers in enhancing or restoring depleted populations.}

  Abstract                 = {1. In analysing the ecological conditions of an animal population we have above all to focus our attention upon the most sensitive stages within the life cycle of the animal, that is, the period of breeding and larval development.
2. Most animal populations on the sea bottom maintain the qualitatively composition of the species composing them, over long periods of time, though the individual species use quite different modes of reproduction and development. This shows that species producing a large number of eggs have a larger wastage of eggs and larvae than those with only a few eggs. The wastage of eggs in the sea is much larger than on the land and in fresh water.
3. In the invertebrate populations on the level sea bottom, large fluctuations in numbers from year to year indicate species with a long pelagic larval life, while a more or less constant occurrence indicates species with a very short pelagic life or a non-pelagic development.
4. In most marine invertebrates which shed their eggs and sperm freely in the water, either (a) the males are the first to spawn, thus stimulating the females to shed their eggs, or (b) an ‘epidemic spawning’ of a whole population takes place within a few hours. Both methods greatly favour the possibility of fertilization of the eggs spawned and show that the heavy wastage of eggs and larvae takes place after fertilization, during the free swimming pelagic life.
5. Embryos with a non-pelagic development may originate (a) from large yolky eggs, in which case all the hatching young of the same species will be at the same stage of development, or (b) from small eggs which during their development feed on nurse eggs, when the individual embryos of the same species may vary enormously in size at the stage of hatching.
6. Three types of pelagic larvae are known: (a) Lecithotrophic larvae, originating from large yolky eggs spawned in small numbers by the individual mother animals; they are independent of the plankton as a source of food although growing during pelagic life, are absent from high arctic seas but constitute about 1o% of the species with pelagic larvae in all other seas, (b) The planktotrophic larvae with a long pelagic life, originating from small eggs spawned in huge numbers by the individual mother animal; they feed from, and grow in, the plankton, constituting less than 5% of high arctic bottom invertebrates, 55–65% of the species in boreal seas, and 8o-85 % of the tropical species, (c) The planktotrophic larvae with a short pelagic life having the same size and organization at the moment of hatching and at the moment of settling; these constitute about 5% of the species in all Recent seas.
7. To find out the factors which cause the enormous waste of eggs and larvae, we thus have to study those forms (constituting 7o% of all species of bottom invertebrates in Recent seas) which have a long planktotrophic pelagic life, as only species reproducing in this way have really large numbers of eggs.
8. The food requirements of the planktotrophic pelagic larvae are much greater than those of the adult animals at the bottom. The adaptability of the larvae to poor food conditions seems, nevertheless, to be greater than hitherto believed. The significance of starvation seems mainly to be an indirect one: poor food conditions cause slow growth, prolong larval life, and give the enemies a longer interval of time to attack and eat the larvae.
9. At the temperatures to which they are normally exposed, northern as well as tropical larvae seem on an average to spend a similar time (about 3 weeks) in the plankton. The length of the pelagic life of the individual species may, however, vary significantly in nature. In the Sound (Denmark) the larvae are never exposed to temperatures outside the range which they are able to endure. The wastage caused by temperature, like that due to starvation, seems mainly to be an indirect one: low temperatures postpone growth and metamorphosis, and give the enemies a longer time to feed on the larvae.
1o. When a larva feeding on a pure algal diet metamorphoses into a carnivorous bottom stage, a ‘physiological revolution’ occurs and a huge waste of larvae might be expected. Experiments have, however, shown that this is not the case.
11. Young pelagic larvae are photopositive and crowd near the surface; larvae about to metamorphose are photonegative. Larval polychaetes, echinoderms, and presumably also prosobranchs, may prolong their pelagic life for days or weeks until they find a suitable substratum. Forced towards the bottom by their photonegativity and transported by currents over wide bottom areas, testing the substratum at intervals, their chance of finding a suitable place for settling is much better than hitherto believed.
12. Continuous currents from the continental shelf towards the open ocean may transport larvae from the coast to the deep sea where they will perish. Such conditions may (for instance in the Gulf of Guinea) deeply influence the composition of the fauna, while in other areas (European western coast, southern California) they seem to be only of small significance.
13. The toll levied by enemies appears to be the most essential source of waste among the larvae. A list of such enemies, comprising other pelagic larvae, holoplank-tonic animals and bottom animals, is given on p. 2o. A medium-sized Mytilus edulis, filtering 1–4 1. of water per hour, may retain and kill about 100,000 pelagic lamellibranch larvae in 24 hr. during the maximum breeding season in a Danish fjord.
14. Species reproducing in a vegetative way, by fission, laceration, budding, etc., might be expected to have good chances of competition in such areas where conditions for sexual reproduction are unfavourable. Nevertheless, they only supply a rather small percentage of the animal populations of all Recent seas, probably because their intensity of reproduction is low and because they are unable to spread to new areas. Most forms reproducing in a vegetative way have sexual reproduction as well.
15. Pelagic development is nearly or totally suspended in the deep sea, and is restricted to the shelf faunas. In the arctic and antarctic seas pelagic development is nearly or totally suppressed, even in the shelf faunas, but starting from here the percentage of forms with pelagic larvae gradually increases as we pass into warmer water, reaching its summit on the tropic shelves.
16. In order to survive in high arctic areas a planktotrophic, pelagic larva has to complete its development from hatching to metamorphosis within I–I ½ months (i.e. the period during which phytoplankton production takes place) at a temperature below 2–4o C. Most larvae, that is in 95% of the species, are unable to do so and have a non-pelagic development, but if a pelagic larva is able to develop under these severe conditions the planktotrophic pelagic life seems to afford good opportunities even in the Arctic. Thus the 5 % of arctic invertebrates reproducing in this way comprise several of the species which quantitatively are most common within the area.
17. The antarctic shore fauna has poor conditions similar to those of the Arctic. The longest continuous periods of phytoplankton production are 2 and 3 weeks respectively, and pelagic larvae have, in order to survive, to complete their development within this short space of time at a temperature between 1 and 4o C. Accordingly, non-pelagic development is the rule, but most arctic species are able to support their non-pelagic development by means of much smaller eggs than the antarctic species, where brood protection and viviparity is dominant. The antarctic fauna has apparently had a longer time to develop its tendency to abandon a pelagic life. The greater the size of the individual born, the smaller its relative food requirements and the better its chance of competing under poor food conditions.
18. The relatively few data on reproduction in deep sea invertebrates point to a non-pelagic development. The larvae of such forms, in order to develop through a planktotrophic pelagic stage, would have to rise by the aid of their own locomotory organs through a water column 2000–4000 m. high or more (often with counteracting currents) to the food producing surface layer, and to cover the same distance when descending to metamorphose and settle.
19. The ecological features common to the deep sea, the arctic and the antarctic seas, which enable the same animals to live and to reproduce there, contribute to explain the ‘equatorial submergence’ of many arctic and antarctic coastal forms.
20. In the tropical coastal zones where the percentage of species with pelagic larvae reaches its maximum, the production of food for the larvae takes place much more continuously than in temperate and arctic seas, because light conditions enable the phytoplankton to assimilate all the year round. The tropical species of marine invertebrates breed (in contrast to temperate and arctic species) within such different seasons that their larval stock, taken as a whole, is more or less equally distributed in the plankton all the year round. This makes the competition in the plankton less keen.
21. The fact that a mode of reproduction and development, well fit for an arctic area, is unfit in a temperate or tropical area of the sea is probably one of the main reasons for the restricted distribution of species.
22. In most groups of marine invertebrates the individual species have only one mode of reproduction and development, which accordingly restricts their area of distribution. In the polychaetes, however, the individual species often show an astonishing lability in their mode of reproduction and development which enables them to compete in wide areas of the sea. Thus, out of the Western European species of polychaetes, 28-4% have been found also in the Indian Ocean, and 18%, at least, along the Californian coast, while the corresponding number of Western European echinoderms, prosobranchs and lamellibranchs found also in the Indian Ocean and California amounts to less than 2%.
23. The pelagic or non-pelagic development of marine prosobranchs has proved to be a very fine ‘barometer’ for ecological conditions. Recent observations, still not elaborated, seem to indicate that the shape of the top whorls, the apex, of the adult shells of prosobranchs may show whether the species in question has a pelagic or a non-pelagic development. This discovery may also give us valuable information about the larval development in fossil species, and help us to form an idea about ecological conditions in sea areas from earlier geological periods.},

  Abstract                 = {The lipid signaling molecule, ceramide, is a key component of the vertebrate stress response, however, there is limited information concerning its role in invertebrate species. In order to identify genes involved in ceramide metabolism in bivalve molluscs, {Pacific} oyster genomic resources were examined for genes associated with ceramide metabolism and signaling. Results
Several genes were identified including full-length sequences characterized for serine palmitoyltransferase-1, 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase, acid ceramidase, and ceramide glucosyltransferase. Genes involved in ceramide synthesis and metabolism are conserved across taxa in both form and function. Expression analysis as assessed by quantitative PCR indicated all genes were expressed at high levels in gill tissue. The role of the ceramide pathway genes in the invertebrate stress response was also explored by measuring expression levels in adult oysters exposed to Vibrio vulnificus. Two genes demonstrated increased expression during the bacterial challenge: a gene involved in hydrolytic breakdown of ceramide (acid ceramidase) and a gene involved in de novo generation of ceramide (3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase), suggesting a possible role of ceramide in the invertebrate stress and immune responses. Conclusions
In silico and laboratory results support that {Pacific} oysters have the basic components of the ceramide metabolism pathway. These results also indicate that ceramide may have analogous functions in vertebrates and invertebrates. The gene expression pattern of acid ceramidase and 3-kethodihydrosphingosine reductase in response to bacterial exposure especially supports that ceramide and sphingolipid metabolism may be involved in the oyster’s stress and/or immune responses.},

  Abstract                 = {Quorum sensing (QS) systems, which depend on N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules, mediate the production of virulence factors in many pathogenic microorganisms. One hundred and forty-six bacterial strains, isolated from a bivalve hatchery, were screened for their capacity to degrade five synthetic AHLs [N-butyryl-dl-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), N-hexanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), N-octanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL), N-decanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C10-HSL) and N-dodecanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C12-HSL)] using well diffusion agar-plate assays with three biosensors, Chromobacterium violaceum CV026, C. violaceum VIR07 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens NTL4 (pZLR4). The results of these assays led to our choosing four strains (PP2-67, PP2-459, PP2-644 and PP2-663) that were able to degrade all five synthetic AHLs, thus showing a wide spectrum of quorum quenching (QQ) activity. We subsequently confirmed and measured the QQ activity of the four strains by high-performance liquid chromatography plus mass-spectrometry analysis (HPLC–MS). One of the strains which showed the highest AHL-degrading activity, PP2-459, identified as being a member of the genus Thalassomonas was chosen for further study. Finally, using thin-layer chromatography (TLC), we went on to confirm this strain's capacity to degrade the AHLs produced by other non-pathogenic and pathogenic bacteria not taxonomically related.},

  Abstract                 = {TLR- and MyD88-related sequences have been previously investigated in Mytibase and then in new transcript reads obtained by Illumina technology from the mussel, \textit{Mytilus galloprovincialis}. Based on full cds and domain organizations of virtual translations, we identified 23 Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and 3 MyD88 adaptors. MgTLRs can be arranged in 4 clusters according to extra-cellular LRR domain content. MgTLR-b, -i and -k were the only ones containing a multiple cysteine cluster (mccTLR), a domain composition also found in Drosophila Toll-1 and 18-wheeler. The 3 MyD88 we identified in \textit{M. galloprovincialis} were also retrieved from \textit{Mytilus edulis}, as well as MgTLR-b and -i. All MgTLRs were constitutively expressed in digestive gland whereas only 4 of them were also present in hemocytes. On the opposite, the 3 MgMyD88s were constitutively expressed in all the tissues. \textit{in vivo} challenge of \textit{M. galloprovincialis} with bacteria caused the up regulation of only MgTLR-i, but of all the 3 MgMyD88s. Highest response was induced by Gram-negative Vibrio anguillarum at 9 h p.i. Injection of filamentous fungus, Fusarium oxysporum, resulted in up regulation of MgTLR-i and MgMyD88-c at 9 h p.i. Such similar pattern of responses suggested MgMyD88-c represents the intra cytoplasm partner of MgTLR-i. Their interaction constituted the first cellular event revealing the existence of a Toll-signaling pathway in Lophotrochozoa.},

  Abstract                 = {To assess the potential of the bearded horse mussel (Modiolus barbatus) and Noah’s Ark shell (Arca noae) for aquaculture in southern Croatia, we analyzed their survival and growth rates under two experimental conditions—suspended culture and on-bottom culture. Furthermore, we investigated feeding on zooplankton by these two species in suspended culture conditions and compared them with previously published results of their feeding on zooplankton in the natural benthic environment. Experimental studies were conducted in Mali Ston Bay (Adriatic Sea) from December 2009 to December 2010. Differences were observed in terms of survival of tagged M. barbatus and A. noae—specimens of M. barbatus exhibited much better survival rates both in suspended culture and in on-bottom cages than did A. noae. Growth of A. noae under both culture conditions was essentially negligible, while M. barbatus grew several times faster in suspended culture than on the bottom. Values for the growth constant K and L inf for M. barbatus in suspended culture were 0.45 year?1 and 55.9 mm, while corresponding values for on-bottom culture were 0.09 year?1 and 58.6 mm, respectively. Zooplankters were present in the stomachs of 86.3 % of M. barbatus and 86.4 % of A. noae. Most abundant taxa were bivalve larvae followed by tintinnids, copepods, unidentified eggs and gastropod larvae. In conclusion, this study clearly shows that M. barbatus is a promising candidate for suspended aquaculture in southern Croatia.},

  Abstract                 = {Aiming at an integrated and mechanistic view of the early biological effects of selected metals in the marine sentinel organism Mytilus galloprovincialis, we exposed mussels for 48 hours to 50, 100 and 200 nM solutions of equimolar Cd, Cu and Hg salts and measured cytological and molecular biomarkers in parallel. Focusing on the mussel gills, first target of toxic water contaminants and actively proliferating tissue, we detected significant dose-related increases of cells with micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities in the treated mussels, with differences in the bioconcentration of the three metals determined in the mussel flesh by atomic absorption spectrometry. Gene expression profiles, determined in the same individual gills in parallel, revealed some transcriptional changes at the 50 nM dose, and substantial increases of differentially expressed genes at the 100 and 200 nM doses, with roughly similar amounts of up- and down-regulated genes. The functional annotation of gill transcripts with consistent expression trends and significantly altered at least in one dose point disclosed the complexity of the induced cell response. The most evident transcriptional changes concerned protein synthesis and turnover, ion homeostasis, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and intracellular trafficking (transcript sequences denoting heat shock proteins, metal binding thioneins, sequestosome 1 and proteasome subunits, and GADD45 exemplify up-regulated genes while transcript sequences denoting actin, tubulins and the apoptosis inhibitor 1 exemplify down-regulated genes). Overall, nanomolar doses of co-occurring free metal ions have induced significant structural and functional changes in the mussel gills: the intensity of response to the stimulus measured in laboratory supports the additional validation of molecular markers of metal exposure to be used in Mussel Watch programs.},

In this study we took a transcriptomic approach to gain insight into the response to viral infection of two strains of the {Pacific} whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) that differ in their resistance to Taura Syndrome Virus (TSV). Changes in gene expression in the hepatopancreas following infection with TSV and Yellow Head Virus (YHV) were assessed using a c{DNA }microarray containing 2469 putative unigenes. The null hypothesis tested was that significant differences between the transcriptomic responses to viral infection of resistant and sensitive strains would not be detected. This hypothesis was broadly rejected, with the most surprising observation being that the baseline (control, unchallenged) sensitive and resistant strains expressed distinguishable transcriptomic signatures. The resistant line was pre-disposed to lower expression of genes encoding viral (and host) proteins. Many of the genes differentiating resistant and sensitive lines are involved in protein metabolism, cellular trafficking, immune defense and stress response, although it was not possible to clearly identify candidate genes responsible for TSV resistance. In contrast to TSV challenge, YSV either failed to perturb the host transcriptome or created a " confused" response that was difficult to interpret. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Sessile bivalves of the genus Mytilus are suspension feeders relatively tolerant to a wide range of environmental changes, used as sentinels in ecotoxicological investigations and marketed worldwide as seafood. Mortality events caused by infective agents and parasites apparently occur less in mussels than in other bivalves but the molecular basis of such evidence is unknown. The arrangement of Mytibase, interactive catalogue of 7,112 transcripts of \textit{M. galloprovincialis}, offered us the opportunity to look for gene sequences relevant to the host defences, in particular the innate immunity related genes. Results
We have explored and described the Mytibase sequence clusters and singletons having a putative role in recognition, intracellular signalling, and neutralization of potential pathogens in \textit{M. galloprovincialis}. Automatically assisted searches of protein signatures and manually cured sequence analysis confirmed the molecular diversity of recognition/effector molecules such as the antimicrobial peptides and many carbohydrate binding proteins. Molecular motifs identifying complement C1q, C-type lectins and fibrinogen-like transcripts emerged as the most abundant in the Mytibase collection whereas, conversely, sequence motifs denoting the regulatory cytokine MIF and cytokine-related transcripts represent singular and unexpected findings. Using a cross-search strategy, 1,820 putatively immune-related sequences were selected to design oligonucleotide probes and define a species-specific Immunochip ({DNA }microarray). The Immunochip performance was tested with hemolymph RNAs from mussels injected with \textit{Vibrio splendidus} at 3 and 48 hours post-treatment. A total of 143 and 262 differentially expressed genes exemplify the early and late hemocyte response of the Vibrio-challenged mussels, respectively, with AMP trends confirmed by qPCR and clear modulation of interrelated signalling pathways. Conclusions
The Mytibase collection is rich in gene transcripts modulated in response to antigenic stimuli and represents an interesting window for looking at the mussel immunome (transcriptomes mediating the mussel response to non-self or abnormal antigens). On this basis, we have defined a new microarray platform, a mussel Immunochip, as a flexible tool for the experimental validation of immune-candidate sequences, and tested its performance on Vibrio-activated mussel hemocytes. The microarray platform and related expression data can be regarded as a step forward in the study of the adaptive response of the Mytilus species to an evolving microbial world.},

ChIP-Seq profiling identifies their genomic binding sites, revealing functional properties. Among the main findings, the human SAGA complex binds to H3K4me3 via a double Tudor-domain in the C terminus of Sgf29, and the PWWP domain is identified as a putative H3K36me3 binding motif. The ORC complex, including LRWD1, binds to the three most prominent transcriptional repressive lysine methylation sites. Our data reveal a highly adapted interplay between chromatin marks and their associated protein complexes.

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: For organisms with planktonic larvae, the early post-settlement stage is a particularly vulnerable one, likely to influence distribution patterns in subsequent life stages. Although substantial post-settlement mortality is well known in several marine invertebrate taxa (e.g. barnacles), few estimates exist for benthic invertebrates, such as mussels, that have mobile settlers. Furthermore, estimates of early post-settlement mortality (within 2 d of settlement) are sparse for most groups. In addressing the difficulties involved with quantifying early mortality of mobile settlers, the present study builds on a sequential-deployment method to estimate the post-settlement mortality of the intertidal mussel Perna perna. Trials were run at 16 sites, split evenly between bay and open coast locations, and were repeated over 2 sampling cycles. By comparing post-settlement mortality estimates from bays and open coast sites, we investigated whether such topographic features produce differential mortality. Post-settlement mortality estimates showed substantial levels of mortality but did not differ significantly between bay and open coast sites. Early post-settlement mortality (i.e. mortality of primary settlers up to 2 d old) ranged from 31 to 94% but averaged 54 and 64% in the 2 sampling cycles. Estimates of total post-settlement mortality (i.e. inclusive of primary and secondary settlers) had a similar range and averaged 66% in Cycle 1 and 67% in Cycle 2. Apart from confirming significant mortality rates of early mussel settlers, these findings suggest that intertidal abundance patterns of recruits and adults, often associated with topographic features of coastlines, are more likely a result of initial settlement patterns than of differences in post-settlement mortality.},

 The first FMRFamide-like immunoreactive (FaLI) cells within CNS appear by E45 embryonic stage (premetamorphic veliger). The number of FaLI neurons increases throughout both pre- and post-hatching development.
 Both transient and sustained expression of FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity by specific sets of neurons occurs. Two cells which transiently express immunoreactivity appear outside the future CNS by the stage E45. Other population of transient FaLI neurons includes bilaterally symmetric groups of cells in the cerebral and pedal ganglia during posthatching stages P1 (hatchlings) to P5 (juveniles). All other immunostained cells which appear during development maintain their transmitter phenotype into adulthood.
 The possible role of FMRFamide-related peptides in the processes of morpho- and neurogenesis is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Although our understanding of neuronal development in Trochozoa has progressed substantially in recent years, relatively little attention has been paid to the bivalve molluscs in this regard. In the present study, the development of FMRFamide-, serotonin- and catecholamine-containing cells in the mussel, Mytilus trossulus, was examined using immunocytochemical and histofluorescent techniques. Neurogenesis starts during the trochophore stage at the apical extreme with the appearance of one FMRFamide-like immunoreactive (lir) and one serotonin-lir sensory cell. Later, five FMRFamide-lir and five serotonin-lir apical sensory cells appear, and their basal fibres form an apical neuropil. Fibres of two lateral FMRFamide-lir apical cells grow posteriorly and at the time that they reach the developing foot, the first FMRFamide-lir neurons of the pedal ganglia also appear. Subsequently, FMRFamide-lir fibres grow further posteriorly and reach the caudal region where neurons of the developing visceral ganglia then begin to appear. In contrast, the five apical serotonin-lir neurons do not appear to project outside the apical neuropil until the late veliger stage. Catecholamine-containing cells are first detected in the veliger stage where they appear above the oesophagus, and subsequently in the velum, foot, and posterior regions. Though neural development in M. trossulus partly resembles that of polyplacophorans in the appearance of the early FMRFamidergic elements, and of scaphopods in the appearance of the early serotonergic elements, the scenario of neural development in M. trossulus differs considerably from that of other Trochozoa (bivalves, gastropods, polyplacophorans, scaphopods and polychaetes) studied to date.},

PI3-kinase was investigated with the use of wortmannin, a specific covalent inhibitor of PI3-kinase. Moreover, phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA), a well-known protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated NADPH oxidase and nitric oxide (NO) synthase stimulator, was also used for elucidating PI3-kinase involvement during the respiratory burst process in challenge hemocytes. According to the results, cells pre-treated with non-toxic concentrations of wortmannin (1 and/or 50 nM, as revealed by neutral red retention assay) for 15 min, showed a significant attenuation of cadmium ability (at concentration of 50 ?M) to promote cell death, superoxide anion (radical dotO2?) production, NO generation and lipid peroxidation (in terms of malondialdehyde equivalents). On the other hand, wortmannin-treated cells showed a significant attenuation of PMA ability to induce NO generation but not radical dotO2? production. These findings reveal that PI3-kinase could lead to a PKC-independent induction of NO synthase activity in cells faced with pro-oxidants, such as cadmium, while its activation could be fundamental for the regulation of NAPDH oxidase activity, probably through a PKC-dependent signaling pathway.},

The understanding of the biology of these angiogenic processes is increasingly driven through studies on vascular development at the cellular resolution. Single cell analysis in vivo, advanced genetic tools and the widespread use of powerful animal models combined with improved imaging possibilities are delivering new insights into endothelial cell form, function and behavior angiogenesis. Moreover, the combination of in silico modeling and experimentation including dynamic imaging promotes insights into higher level cooperative behavior leading to functional patterning of vascular networks.

Within 48?h of fertilization, unshelled {Pacific} oyster (\textit{Crassostrea gigas}) larvae precipitate roughly 90% of their body weight as calcium carbonate. We measured stable carbon isotopes in larval shell and tissue and in algal food and seawater dissolved inorganic carbon in a longitudinal study of larval development and growth. Using these data and measured biochemical composition of larvae, we show that sensitivity of initial shell formation to ocean acidification results from diminished ability to isolate calcifying fluid from surrounding seawater, a limited energy budget and a strong kinetic demand for calcium carbonate precipitation. Our results highlight an important link between organism physiology and mineral kinetics in larval bivalves and suggest the consideration of mineral kinetics may improve understanding winners and losers in a high CO2 world.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a simulation approach to help determine the optimal mixture of sequencing methods for most complete and cost effective transcriptome sequencing. We compared simulation results for traditional capillary sequencing with "Next Generation" (NG) ultra high-throughput technologies. The simulation model was parameterized using mappings of 130,000 c{DNA }sequence reads to the Arabidopsis genome (NCBI Accession SRA008180.19). We also generated 454-GS20 sequences and de novo assemblies for the basal eudicot California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) and the magnoliid avocado (Persea {American}a) using a variety of methods for c{DNA }synthesis. Results
The Arabidopsis reads tagged more than 15,000 genes, including new splice variants and extended UTR regions. Of the total 134,791 reads (13.8 MB), 119,518 (88.7%) mapped exactly to known exons, while 1,117 (0.8%) mapped to introns, 11,524 (8.6%) spanned annotated intron/exon boundaries, and 3,066 (2.3%) extended beyond the end of annotated UTRs. Sequence-based inference of relative gene expression levels correlated significantly with microarray data. As expected, NG sequencing of normalized libraries tagged more genes than non-normalized libraries, although non-normalized libraries yielded more full-length c{DNA }sequences. The Arabidopsis data were used to simulate additional rounds of NG and traditional EST sequencing, and various combinations of each. Our simulations suggest a combination of FLX and Solexa sequencing for optimal transcriptome coverage at modest cost. We have also developed ESTcalc http://fgp.huck.psu.edu/NG_Sims/ngsim.pl webcite, an online webtool, which allows users to explore the results of this study by specifying individualized costs and sequencing characteristics. Conclusion
NG sequencing technologies are a highly flexible set of platforms that can be scaled to suit different project goals. In terms of sequence coverage alone, the NG sequencing is a dramatic advance over capillary-based sequencing, but NG sequencing also presents significant challenges in assembly and sequence accuracy due to short read lengths, method-specific sequencing errors, and the absence of physical clones. These problems may be overcome by hybrid sequencing strategies using a mixture of sequencing methodologies, by new assemblers, and by sequencing more deeply. Sequencing and microarray outcomes from multiple experiments suggest that our simulator will be useful for guiding NG transcriptome sequencing projects in a wide range of organisms.},

In the present study, the full-length c{DNA }of AIF-1 was identified from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri (named as CfAIF-1) by EST (expressed sequence tag) analysis and RACE (rapid-amplification of c{DNA }ends) approaches. The c{DNA }of CfAIF-1 consisted of a 5-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 58 bp, a 3-UTR of 607 bp with a poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 468 bp encoding a polypeptide of 155 amino acids with the putative molecular mass of 17.8 kDa. There was an EF hand Ca2 +-binding motif in the deduced amino acid sequence of CfAIF-1 which was conserved in other AIF-1s. CfAIF-1 shared closer phylogenetic relationship with invertebrate counterparts than vertebrate. The mRNA transcripts of CfAIF-1 were dominantly expressed in hepatopancreas, hemocytes and adductor. During scallop ontogenesis, the CfAIF-1 mRNA was expressed at a low level at early developmental stages from eggs to blastula, and then increased significantly from gastruta to late veliger larvae (P < 0.05). Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of CfAIF-1 in the hemocytes of adult scallop were significantly up-regulated during 12–48 h after LPS, PGN and poly I:C stimulation (P < 0.01), but there was no significant fluctuation detected after glucan stimulation. Furthermore, the challenge of bacteria Vibrio anguillarum remarkably induced the mRNA expression of CfAIF-1 in hemocytes at 6 h (P < 0.05) and 12 h (P < 0.01). All these results collectively indicated that CfAIF-1 might be involved in the immune response during the ontogenesis and contribute to the defense against microbe infection in scallops.},

In the present study, the sequence features and mRNA expression profiles of five key genes involved in TLR signal pathway were characterized, and their functions in the immune responses were also investigated in order to validate the TLR signaling pathway and its potential roles in the immune defense of Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri. These five genes, including CfTLR, CfMyD88, CfTRAF6, CfI?B and CfNF?B, exhibited significant similarity with their homologues from other model organisms, and contained the typical motifs. A strong interaction between the TIR domain from CfTLR and CfMyD88 protein was revealed via ELISA assays. The mRNA transcripts of these five genes were all up-regulated after LPS stimulation, indicating that they were involved in the immune response against LPS. When CfTLR expression was inhibited by RNAi technology, the mRNA expression level of CfMyD88, CfTRAF6, CfI?B, CfNF?B and G-type lysozyme were all decreased, while those of superoxide dismutase and catalase were increased. After Listonella anguillara challenge, the apoptosis level of those CfTLR-suppressed scallops was significantly lower than that in control groups (p < 0.05) at the beginning of bacteria challenge, while the cumulative mortality was significantly higher than that of control groups (p < 0.05). These results collectively favored that a rather canonical MyD88-dependent TLR pathway existed in scallop and this pathway was involved in immune signaling to active the diverse downstream reaction including anti-oxidant, anti-bacteria and apoptosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Bivalves play an important role in the ecosystems they inhabit and represent an important food source all over the world. So far limited genetic research has focused on this group of animals largely due to the lack of sufficient genetic or genomic resources. Here, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce the most comprehensive expressed sequence tag resource for Zhikong scallop (\textit{Chlamys farreri}), and conducted the first transcriptome comparison for scallops. Results
In a single 454 sequencing run, 1,033,636 reads were produced and then assembled into 26,165 contigs. These contigs were then clustered into 24,437 isotigs and further grouped into 20,056 isogroups. About 47% of the isogroups showed significant matches to known proteins based on sequence similarity. Transcripts putatively involved in growth, reproduction and stress/immune-response were identified through Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses. Transcriptome comparison with Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) revealed similar patterns of GO representation. Moreover, 38 putative fast-evolving genes were identified through analyzing the orthologous gene pairs between the two scallop species. More than 46,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 350 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were also detected. Conclusion
Our study provides the most comprehensive transcriptomic resource currently available for C. farreri. Based on this resource, we performed the first large-scale transcriptome comparison between the two scallop species, C. farreri and P. yessoensis, and identified a number of putative fast-evolving genes, which may play an important role in scallop speciation and/or local adaptation. A large set of single nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats were identified, which are ready for downstream marker development. This transcriptomic resource should lay an important foundation for future genetic or genomic studies on C. farreri.},

  Abstract                 = {This study was designed to investigate the possible role of Meretrix meretrix cathepsin B (MmeCB) in embryonic and larval development. MmeCB mRNA expression profile was revealed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The level of MmeCB mRNA expression was low in trochophore stage but high in pedveliger stage. MmeCB protein expression was detected in the digestive gland, velum, and epidermis along the edges of the shell in D-larvae and pedveligers by immunocytochemistry. In post larvae, MmeCB protein expression was noticed abundant in the digestive gland, whereas a modest expression was identified in the gill filament. The average shell length of larvae hatched from embryos treated with 0.01, 1, and 10?µmol/L Ca074Me (a cathepsin B inhibitor) was significantly shorter than that of control groups. The metamorphosis rates of larvae treated with 0.01 and 1?µmol/L Ca074Me were significantly lower than that of control groups in 4-day larvae, but not in 5-day larvae. Taken together, these results indicated that MmeCB may have stimulatory effects on embryonic development, metamorphosis, and larval growth during M. meretrix larval development. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol.

  Abstract                 = {Seed rearing is an important part in large scale clam culture industry. Since the nutritional history affects early development in bivalve, the condition of larval nutrition plays a key role in successful seed rearing. So far, the molecular mechanism of nutrient uptake in bivalve larvae is unclear. As one of the important proteolytic enzymes, cathepsin B of several organisms has been reported to be involved in digestion. We intended to analyze whether cathepsin B is involved in larval nutrient metabolism in the economic bivalve, clam \textit{Meretrix meretrix}. The full length of M. meretrix cathepsin B (MmeCB) c{DNA }was cloned, which is 1647 bp with an open reading frame of 1014 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded a preproenzyme of 337 residues with Cys-114, His-282 and Asn-302 composing cathepsin B activity center. The temporal and spatial expressions of MmeCB mRNA were examined from trochophore to post larva stages by whole mount in situ hybridization. In trochophore stage, no detectable signal was found. In the later three stages, MmeCB mRNA was detected in the digestive gland, suggesting a possible role of MmeCB in digestion. Moreover, MmeCB mRNA was also observed in the epidermal cells in D-veligers. Cathepsin B specific inhibitor (CA074 methyl ester) was applied to block the activity of cathepsin B in unfed larvae. The average shell lengths of treated larvae were smaller than that in control groups. The results of mRNA epidermal distribution and inhibitor treatment in D-veligers indicated that MmeCB may be also associated with other pathway of nutrient metabolism in larval epidermis. The overall results in this paper revealed that MmeCB might play a role in larval nutrient metabolism.},

  Abstract                 = {The complex interactions among host, pathogen and environment are believed to be the main causes for the mass mortality of cultured scallops. In the present study, the temporal variations of immune parameters and cellular energy allocation (CEA) of \textit{Chlamys farreri} under ammonia-N, Vibrio anguillarum as well as their combined treatment were investigated to better understand the energetic mechanisms of scallop in immune defense. After 1 d exposure to ammonia-N, V. anguillarum and their combination, the superoxide anion level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the serum of scallops increased substantially. At 24 d post exposure, the mRNA expression levels of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70), HSP 90 and glutamine synthetase (GS), as well as the malondialdehyde content remarkably increased, while SOD activity was depressed significantly (P < 0.05). The glycogen reserved in the tissues from scallops exposed to the combined stress for 1 d, 12 d and 24 d were significantly lower than those in the control (P < 0.05). The CEA values in all the examined tissues including gonad, gill, hepatopancreas and adductor muscle were significantly lower than those of control (P < 0.05) when exposure to ammonia-N, V. anguillarum and their combined treatment for 12 and 24 d. Furthermore, the combined stress also had a significant impact upon CEA in all the examined tissues in scallops post 1 d exposure (P < 0.05). The above results demonstrated that SOD, IDH, HSPs and GS in hemolymph of treated scallops are necessary, but not sufficient to the complete protection against stress-induced cellular damage along with the treatment duration. Immune defense against the combination of pathogen invasion and environmental stress can impose greater costs on scallop’s energy expenditure than a single stressor, and the combined treatment preferentially consumed more available glycogen in scallops for immune defense. Hence, in addition to be used in immunological evaluation, CEA is also a powerful tool to provide valuable insights into possible mechanisms of mass mortalities in cultured scallops.},

  Abstract                 = {A {DNA }microarray can track the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Previous research has demonstrated that this technology can be useful in the classification of cancers. Cancer microarray data normally contains a small number of samples which have a large number of gene expression levels as features. To select relevant genes involved in different types of cancer remains a challenge. In order to extract useful gene information from cancer microarray data and reduce dimensionality, feature selection algorithms were systematically investigated in this study. Using a correlation-based feature selector combined with machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, nave Bayes and support vector machines, we show that classification performance at least as good as published results can be obtained on acute leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma microarray data sets. We also demonstrate that a combined use of different classification and feature selection approaches makes it possible to select relevant genes with high confidence. This is also the first paper which discusses both computational and biological evidence for the involvement of zyxin in leukaemogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {The interferons (IFNs) were originally described over 50 years ago, identified by their ability to confer viral resistance to cells. We now know that they are much more than just anti-viral cytokines collectively having roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses, in tumor surveillance and defense, and modulation of immune cell function. Three types of IFN have now been described, simply referred to as type I, II and III. Distinguishable by the unique receptors that they rely on for signal transduction, the three types of IFN have specific and varied roles in the maintenance of human health and defense against pathogens. In mounting an IFN-mediated immune response, the human body has developed the ability to regulate IFN-mediated signal transduction. Like all cytokines, the ability of a cell to respond to IFN is completely dependent on the presence of its cognate receptor on the surface of the target cell. Thus, one of the major mechanisms used by the human body to regulate the strength and duration of the IFN response is through regulation of receptor levels, thereby altering the cytokine-specific responsiveness of the target cell. This review will discuss the receptor system utilized by the type I IFNs and compare it with that of the type II and III IFNs, which also regulate immune responses through controlling receptor level on the cell surface.},

  Abstract                 = {Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) play crucial role in innate immunity for both invertebrates and vertebrates, owing to their prominent ability in detecting and eliminating invading bacteria. In the present study, two short PGRPs from mollusk Solen grandis (designated as SgPGRP-S1 and SgPGRP-S2) were identified, and their expression patterns, both in tissues and toward three PAMPs stimulation, were then characterized. The full-length c{DNA }of SgPGRP-S1 and SgPGRP-S2 was 1672 and 1285 bp, containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 813 and 426 bp, respectively, and deduced amino acid sequences showed high similarity to other members of PGRP superfamily. Both SgPGRP-S1 and SgPGRP-S2 encoded a PGRP domain. The motif of Zn2+ binding sites and amidase catalytic sites were well conserved in SgPGRP-S1, but partially conserved in SgPGRP-S2. The two PGRPs exhibited different tissue expression pattern. SgPGRP-S1 was highly expressed in muscle and hepatopancreas, while SgPGRP-S2 was highly in gill and mantle. The mRNA expression of SgPGRP-S1 could be induced acutely by stimulation of PGN, and also moderately by ?-1,3-glucan, but not by LPS, while expression of SgPGRP-S2 was significantly up-regulated (P < 0.01) when S. grandis was stimulated by all the three PAMPs, though the expression levels were relatively lower than SgPGRP-S1. Our results suggested SgPGRP-S1 and SgPGRP-S2 could serve as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in the immune recognition of S. grandis, and they might perform different functions in the immune defense against invaders.},

However, the development of the probe-independent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach has begun to revolutionize transcriptomics. Here, we assess the feasibility of taking transcriptomics one step further by performing 'dual RNA-seq', in which gene expression changes in both the pathogen and the host are analysed simultaneously.},

  Abstract                 = {Ocean acidification, characterized by elevated pCO2 and the associated decreases in seawater pH and calcium carbonate saturation state (?), has a variable impact on the growth and survival of marine invertebrates. Larval stages are thought to be particularly vulnerable to environmental stressors, and negative impacts of ocean acidification have been seen on fertilization as well as on embryonic, larval, and juvenile development and growth of bivalve molluscs. We investigated the effects of high CO2 exposure (resulting in pH = 7.39, ?ar = 0.74) on the larvae of the bay scallop Argopecten irradians from 12 h to 7 d old, including a switch from high CO2 to ambient CO2 conditions (pH = 7.93, ?ar = 2.26) after 3 d, to assess the possibility of persistent effects of early exposure. The survival of larvae in the high CO2 treatment was consistently lower than the survival of larvae in ambient conditions, and was already significantly lower at 1 d. Likewise, the shell length of larvae in the high CO2 treatment was significantly smaller than larvae in the ambient conditions throughout the experiment and by 7 d, was reduced by 11.5%. This study also demonstrates that the size effects of short-term exposure to high CO2 are still detectable after 7 d of larval development; the shells of larvae exposed to high CO2 for the first 3 d of development and subsequently exposed to ambient CO2 were not significantly different in size at 3 and 7 d than the shells of larvae exposed to high CO2 throughout the experiment.},

  Abstract                 = {Global climate change is projected to accelerate during the next century, altering oceanic patterns in temperature, pH and oxygen concentrations. Documenting patterns of genetic adaptation to these variables in locations that currently experience geographic variation in them is an important tool in understanding the potential for natural selection to allow populations to adapt as climate change proceeds. We sequenced the mantle transcriptome of 39 red abalone (\textit{Haliotis rufescensi}) individuals from three regions (Monterey Bay, Sonoma, north of Cape Mendocino) distinct in temperature, aragonite saturation, exposure to hypoxia and disease pressure along the California coast. Among 1.17 × 106 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in this study (1.37% of the transcriptome), 21 579 could be genotyped for all individuals. A principal components analysis concluded that the vast majority of SNPs show no population structure from Monterey, California to the Oregon border, in corroboration with several previous studies. In contrast, an FST outlier analysis indicated 691 SNPs as exhibiting significantly higher than expected differentiation (experiment-wide P < 0.05). From these, it was possible to identify 163 genes through BLAST annotation, 34 of which contained more than one outlier SNP. A large number of these genes are involved in biomineralization, energy metabolism, heat-, disease- or hypoxia-tolerance. These genes are candidate loci for spatial adaptation to geographic variation that is likely to increase in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {The opisthobranch gastropod Aplysia californica serves as a model organism in experimental neurobiology because of its simple and well-known nervous system. However, its nervous periphery has been less intensely studied. We have reconstructed the ontogeny of the cephalic sensory organs (labial tentacles, rhinophores, and lip) of planktonic, metamorphic, and juvenile developmental stages. FMRFamide and serotonergic expression patterns have been examined by immunocytochemistry in conjunction with epifluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy. We have also applied scanning electron microscopy to analyze the ciliary distribution of these sensory epithelia. Labial tentacles and the lip develop during metamorphosis, whereas rhinophores appear significantly later, in stage 10 juveniles. Our study has revealed immunoreactivity against FMRFamides and serotonin in all major nerves. The common labial nerve develops first, followed by the labial tentacle base nerve, oral nerve, and rhinophoral nerve. We have also identified previously undescribed neuronal pathways and other FMRFamide-like-immunoreactive neuronal elements, such as peripheral ganglia and glomerulus-like structures, and two groups of conspicuous transient FMRFamide-like cell somata. We have further found two distinct populations of FMRFamide-positive cell somata located both subepidermally and in the inner regions of the cephalic sensory organs in juveniles. The latter population partly consists of sensory cells, suggesting an involvement of FMRFamide-like peptides in the modulation of peripheral sensory processes. This study is the first concerning the neurogenesis of cephalic sensory organs in A. californica and may serve as a basis for future studies of neuronal elements in gastropod molluscs. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

The resulting combined sequence data are subsequently sorted by barcode before bioinformatic analysis. This unit contains a barcoding protocol for the preparation of up to 96 ChIP samples for multiplex sequencing in a single flow cell lane on the Illumina platform. This strategy may be extended to even larger numbers of samples and may also be generalized to other sequencing applications or sequencing platforms. Curr. Protoc. Mol.

  Abstract                 = {The brain renin–angiotensin system (RAS) has long been known to regulate several classic physiologies including blood pressure, sodium and water balance, cyclicity of reproductive hormones and sexual behaviors, and pituitary gland hormones. These physiologies are thought to be under the control of the angiotensin II (AngII)/AT1 receptor subtype system. The AT2 receptor subtype is expressed during fetal development and is less abundant in the adult. This receptor appears to oppose growth responses facilitated by the AT1 receptor, as well as growth factor receptors. Recent evidence points to an important contribution by the brain RAS to non-classic physiologies mediated by the newly discovered angiotensin IV (AngIV)/AT4 receptor subtype system. These physiologies include the regulation of blood flow, modulation of exploratory behavior, and a facilitory role in learning and memory acquisition. This system appears to interact with brain matrix metalloproteinases in order to modify extracellular matrix molecules thus permitting the synaptic remodeling critical to the neural plasticity presumed to underlie memory consolidation, reconsolidation, and retrieval. There is support for an inhibitory influence by AngII activation of the AT1 subtype, and a facilitory role by AngIV activation of the AT4 subtype, on neuronal firing rate, long-term potentiation, associative and spatial learning. The discovery of the AT4 receptor subtype, and its facilitory influence upon learning and memory, suggest an important role for the brain RAS in normal cognitive processing and perhaps in the treatment of dysfunctional memory disease states.},

  Abstract                 = {Lysozymes are important proteins to bivalve in the innate immune responses against bacterial infections, and provide nutrition as digestion enzymes. A new LYZ1 from the freshwater mussel Cristaria plicata was cloned by rapid amplification of c{DNA }ends (RACE) and nested PCR method. The full-length c{DNA }sequence of CpLYZ1 was 763 bp. The c{DNA }contained a 5?-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 21 bp, a 3?- terminal UTR of 259 bp with a 29 bp poly(A) tail, a tailing signal (AATAAA) and the open reading frame of 483 bp. The CpLYZ1 c{DNA }encoded a polypeptide of 160 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.8 kDa, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.07. The comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with LYZs from other species showed that the enzyme belonged to i-type lysozyme. The mRNA transcript of CpLYZ1 could be detected in all the examined tissues with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. The expression levels of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes, hepatopancreas and gill significantly increased after Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. The expression level of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes sharply decreased from 6 h to 24 h and significantly increased at 48 h, and was the highest level in hepatopancreas at 24 h, and was the maximum level in gill at 48 h. Furthermore, the recombinant CpLYZ1 was induced to be expressed as an inclusion body form by IPTG at 37 °C for 4 h, and then was purified by using the Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The relative enzyme activity of the recombinant CpLYZ1 was influenced on pH and temperature. The optimal pH and temperature was 5.5 and 50 °C, respectively. Against Escherichia coli, A. hydrophila, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus sp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the recombinant CpLYZ1 had bacteriolytic activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Hypoxia affects thousands of km2 of marine waters all over the world, and has caused mass mortality of marine animals, benthic defaunation and decline in fisheries production in many places. The severity, frequency occurrence and spatial scale of hypoxia have increased in the last few decades. Due to rapid human population growth and global warming, the problem of hypoxia is likely to become worse in the coming years.
Molecular responses of marine animals to hypoxia are poorly known. In many animals, a haem protein probably serves as the cellular sensor for oxygen, and reactive oxygen species are generated as signaling molecules. In mammal and fish, a heterodimeric transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) has been identified. HIF-1 receives signals from the molecular oxygen senor through redox reactions and/or phosphorylation, and in turn, regulates the transcription of a number of hypoxia-inducible genes, including genes involved in erythropoiesis, angiogenesis and glycolysis. These molecular responses then cascade into a series of biochemical and physiological adjustments, enabling the animal to survive better under hypoxic conditions.
Marine animals respond to hypoxia by first attempting to maintain oxygen delivery (e.g. increases in respiration rate, number of red blood cells, or oxygen binding capacity of hemoglobin), then by conserving energy (e.g. metabolic depression, down regulation of protein synthesis and down regulation/modification of certain regulatory enzymes). Upon exposure to prolonged hypoxia, animals must eventually resort to anaerobic respiration. Hypoxia reduces growth and feeding, which may eventually affect individual fitness. Effects of hypoxia on reproduction and development of marine animals, albeit important in affecting species survival, remain almost unknown.
Many fish and marine organisms can detect, and actively avoid hypoxia. Some benthos may leave their burrows and move to sediment surface during hypoxia. These behaviorial changes may render the animals more vulnerable to predation. Hypoxia may eliminate sensitive species, thereby causing major changes in species composition of benthic, fish and phytoplankton communities. Decreases in species diversity and species richness are well documented, and changes in trophodynamics and functional groups have also been reported. Under hypoxic conditions, there is a general tendency for suspended feeders to be replaced by deposit feeders; demersal fish by pelagic fish; and macrobenthos by meiobenthos. Microflagellates and nanoplankton also tend to dominate in the phytoplankton community in hypoxic environments. Existing evidence suggest that recovery of benthic communities in temperate region take two to several years. Recovery however, appears to be much quicker in subtropical environments.
In natural conditions, hypoxia is often associated with increases in ammonia, hydrogen sulphide and particulate organic materials. The inability to isolate effects of hypoxia from interactions of these compounding factors makes it difficult to attribute many of the observed ecological effects to hypoxia.},

  Abstract                 = {Crassostrea ariakensis Gould is a representative bivalve species and an economically important oyster in China, but suffers severe mortalities in recent years that are caused by rickettsia-like organism (RLO). Prevention and control of this disease is a priority for the development of oyster aquaculture. It has been proven that mammalian HMGB (high mobility group box) can be released extracellularly and acts as an important pro-inflammatory cytokine and late mediator of inflammatory reactions. In vertebrates, HMGB’s antibody (anti-HMGB) has been shown to confer significant protection against certain local and systemic inflammatory diseases. Therefore, we investigated the functions of Ca-HMGB (oyster HMGB) and anti-CaHMGB (Ca-HMGB’s antibody) in oyster RLO/LPS (RLO or LPS)-induced disease or inflammation. Methodology/Principal Findings
Sequencing analysis revealed Ca-HMGB shares conserved structures with mammalians. Tissue-specific expression indicates that Ca-HMGB has higher relative expression in hemocytes. Significant continuous up-regulation of Ca-HMGB was detected when the hemocytes were stimulated with RLO/LPS. Recombinant Ca-HMGB protein significantly up-regulated the expression levels of some cytokines. Indirect immunofluorescence study revealed that Ca-HMGB localized both in the hemocyte nucleus and cytoplasm before RLO challenge, but mainly in the cytoplasm 12 h after challenge. Western blot analysis demonstrated Ca-HMGB was released extracellularly 4–12 h after RLO challenge. Anti-CaHMGB was added to the RLO/LPS-challenged hemocyte monolayer and real-time RT-PCR showed that administration of anti-CaHMGB dramatically reduced the rate of RLO/LPS-induced up-regulation of LITAF at 4–12 h after treatment. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that administration of anti-CaHMGB reduced RLO/LPS-induced hemocyte apoptosis and necrosis rates. Conclusions/Significance
Ca-HMGB can be released extracellularly and its subcellular localization varies when stimulated with RLO. Ca-HMGB is involved in oyster immune reactions and functions as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Anti-CaHMGB can significantly suppress RLO/LPS-induced inflammatory responses and hemocyte necrosis and apoptosis, suggesting that Ca-HMGB is a potential target to prevent and control RLO/LPS-induced disease or inflammation.},

  Abstract                 = {High throughput parallel sequencing, RNA-Seq, has recently emerged as an appealing alternative to microarray in identifying differentially expressed genes (DEG) between biological groups. However, there still exists considerable discrepancy on gene expression measurements and DEG results between the two platforms. The objective of this study was to compare parallel paired-end {RNA-seq} and microarray data generated on 5-azadeoxy-cytidine (5-Aza) treated HT-29 colon cancer cells with an additional simulation study. Methods
We first performed general correlation analysis comparing gene expression profiles on both platforms. An Errors-In-Variables (EIV) regression model was subsequently applied to assess proportional and fixed biases between the two technologies. Then several existing algorithms, designed for DEG identification in {RNA-seq} and microarray data, were applied to compare the cross-platform overlaps with respect to DEG lists, which were further validated using qRT-PCR assays on selected genes. Functional analyses were subsequently conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Results
Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between the {RNA-seq} and microarray data each exceeded 0.80, with 66%~68% overlap of genes on both platforms. The EIV regression model indicated the existence of both fixed and proportional biases between the two platforms. The DESeq and baySeq algorithms (RNA-Seq) and the SAM and eBayes algorithms (microarray) achieved the highest cross-platform overlap rate in DEG results from both experimental and simulated datasets. DESeq method exhibited a better control on the false discovery rate than baySeq on the simulated dataset although it performed slightly inferior to baySeq in the sensitivity test. {RNA-seq} and qRT-PCR, but not microarray data, confirmed the expected reversal of SPARC gene suppression after treating HT-29 cells with 5-Aza. Thirty-three IPA canonical pathways were identified by both microarray and {RNA-seq} data, 152 pathways by {RNA-seq} data only, and none by microarray data only. Conclusions
These results suggest that {RNA-seq}has advantages over microarray in identification of DEGs with the most consistent results generated from DESeq and SAM methods. The EIV regression model reveals both fixed and proportional biases between {RNA-seq}and microarray. This may explain in part the lower cross-platform overlap in DEG lists compared to those in detectable genes.},

Furthermore, in some complex genomes, it is hard to increase the N50 length even with large mate-pair libraries, which leads to low transcript coverage. Thus, it is necessary to develop other simple scaffolding approaches, to at least solve the elongation of transcribed fragments. Results
We describe L_RNA_scaffolder, a novel genome scaffolding method that uses long transcriptome reads to order, orient and combine genomic fragments into larger sequences. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, the zebrafish genome was scaffolded. With expanded human transcriptome data, the N50 of human genome was doubled and L_RNA_scaffolder out-performed most scaffolding results by existing scaffolders which employ mate-pair libraries. In these two examples, the transcript coverage was almost complete, especially for long transcripts. We applied L_RNA_scaffolder to the highly polymorphic pearl oyster draft genome and the gene model length significantly increased. Conclusions
The simplicity and high-throughput of {RNA-seq}data makes this approach suitable for genome scaffolding.},

In this study, for the first time we clone and characterize the cDNAs designated as adrenergic-like receptor (ARcga) from Crassostrea angulata. The deduced protein ARcga has high similarity with ?2-adrenergic receptor (?2-AR) from Ixodes scapularis, and includes three major domains composed of a transmembrane domain with seven transmembrane motifs, a relatively long third cytoplasmic loop and a short fourth inner terminal domain. Using a real-time PCR approach, expression profiles of the ARcga were analyzed in adult tissues and during larval development. In adult oyster, the ARcga was expressed ubiquitously, although transcript levels varied between organs; the highest mRNA level was detected in labium followed by mantle and gonad. ARcga expression increased during larval development and reached the highest level at eyespot larvae, and then the expressions were maintained in a high level during metamorphosis. The temporal and spatial expression profile of mRNA was examined from trochophore to eyespot larva stages by whole mount in situ hybridization. In the four stages, ARcga mRNA was mainly detected in the cerebral ganglion and or the apical organ, the pedal ganglion and around the heart. The ganglion differentiation was found in the early umbo-veliger larva. To evaluate the possible regulation of ARcga by adrenaline in the oyster metamorphosis, competent larvae were exposed to the neurotransmitter adrenaline. ARcga expression increased for the first 12 h after treatment and then ARcga mRNA level decreases gradually to the same level of untreated control group. Overall, these results suggest that ARcga might play a considerable role in signal transduction during the larval metamorphosis of C. angulata},

  Abstract                 = {Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) is an essential molecule in innate immunity for both invertebrates and vertebrates, owing to its prominent ability in detecting and eliminating the invading bacteria. Several PGRPs have been identified from mollusk, but their functions and the underlined mechanism are still unclear. In the present study, the mRNA expression profiles, location, and possible functions of PGRP-S1 from Zhikong scallop \textit{Chlamys farreri} ({CfPGRP-S1}) were analyzed. The CfPGRP-S1 protein located in the mantle, gill, kidney and gonad of the scallops. Its mRNA expression in hemocytes was up-regulated extremely after PGN stimulation (P < 0.01), while moderately after the stimulations of LPS (P < 0.01) and ?-glucan (P < 0.05). The recombinant protein of CfPGRP-S1 (designated as rCfPGRP-S1) exhibited high affinity to PGN and moderate affinity to LPS, but it did not bind ?-glucan. Meanwhile, rCfPGRP-S1 also exhibited strong agglutination activity to Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis and weak activity to Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli. More importantly, rCfPGRP-S1 functioned as a bactericidal amidase to degrade PGN and strongly inhibit the growth of E. coli and Staphyloccocus aureus in the presence of Zn2+. These results indicated that CfPGRP-S1 could not only serve as a pattern recognition receptor recognizing bacterial PGN and LPS, but also function as a scavenger involved in eliminating response against the invaders.},

  Abstract                 = {In a previous study using hemocytes from native and invasive congeners of Mytilus (\textit{Mytilus californianus} and \textit{Mytilus galloprovincialis}, respectively) we showed that {DNA }damage and cell signaling transduction processes related to the cellular stress response and apoptosis were induced by acute temperature stress. The present study extends this work by examining effects of acute heat- and cold stress on total hemocyte counts (THCs) and expression of key regulatory molecules involved in responding to stress: tumor suppressor factor (p53), cell cycle arrest activator (p21), and a {DNA }base excision repair enzyme (apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE)). Hyperthermia (28 °C, 32 °C) led to significant decreases of THCs in both species. The extent of decrease in THC was temperature-, time-, and species-dependent; lower THC values were found in M. californianus, the more cold-adapted species. Western blot analyses of hemocyte extracts with antibodies specific for p53 protein, several site-specific phosphorylation states of p53, p21 protein, and APE indicated that heat- and cold (2 °C) stress induced a time-dependent activation of stress-related proteins in response to {DNA }damage; these stress-induced changes could govern cell cycle arrest or {DNA }damage repair. Our results show that the downstream regulatory response to temperature-induced cell damage may play an important role in deciding cellular fate following heat- and cold stress. Compared to M. californianus, the more warm-adapted \textit{M. galloprovincialis} appears to have a higher temperature tolerance due to a lesser reduction in THC, faster signaling activation and transduction, and stronger {DNA }repair ability following heat stress.},

Both heat stress (28, 32°C) and cold stress (2, 6°C) led to significant double- and single-stranded breaks in {DNA}. The type and extent of {DNA} damage were temperature and time dependent, as was caspase-3 activation, an indicator of apoptosis, which may occur in response to {DNA} damage. Hemocyte viability and lysosomal membrane stability decreased significantly under heat stress. Western blot analyses of hemocyte extracts with antibodies for proteins associated with cell signaling and stress responses [including members of the phospho-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family c-JUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-MAPK, and apoptosis executor caspase-3] revealed that heat and cold stress induced a time-dependent activation of JNK, p38-MAPK and caspase-3 and that these signaling and stress responses differed between species. The thermal limits for activation of cell signaling processes linked to the repair of stress-induced damage may help determine cellular thermal tolerance limits. Our results show similarities in responses to cold and heat stress and suggest causal linkages between levels of {DNA} damage at both extremes of temperature and downstream regulatory responses, including induction of apoptosis. Compared with M. californianus, M. galloprovincialis might have a wider temperature tolerance due to a lower amount of single- and double-stranded {DNA} damage, faster signaling activation and transduction, and stronger repair ability against temperature stress.}

In this study, the expression patterns of MmeLys mRNA and protein at four chief developmental stages of M. meretrix were analyzed, which was able to provide information about how ontogeny of immunity and, in particular, antibacterial ability occured in the bivalve. The results of real-time PCR and western blot showed that MmeLys expressions were activated in D-veligers and dramatically increased to the highest level in pediveligers. It is proposed that the expression changes at these two stages might be due to the visceral organs changes, which were related to the archenteron formation in D-veligers and the organ-restructuring in pediveligers during metamorphosis. In addition, new methods of whole mount in situ hybridization and whole mount immunofluorescence were applied to identify the MmeLys expression tissues, and these tissues (i.e. hepatopancreas, gill, mantle, mouth, velum and foot) may be involved in the immune function during development of clams. Our study is valuable to a certain extent for exploring the origin of immune functions in clams and provides new methodology for future studies on the immune ontogeny of bivalves.},

The goal of this study is to quantify some of the sources of error that affect measurement of expression using Agilent arrays and to compare Agilent's Feature Extraction software with pre-processing methods that have become the standard for normalization of c{DNA }arrays. These include log transformation followed by loess normalization with or without background subtraction and often a between array scale normalization procedure. The larger goal is to define best study design and pre-processing practices for Agilent arrays, and we offer some suggestions. Results
Simple loess normalization without background subtraction produced the lowest variability. However, without background subtraction, fold changes were biased towards zero, particularly at low intensities. ROC analysis of a spike-in experiment showed that differentially expressed genes are most reliably detected when background is not subtracted. Loess normalization and no background subtraction yielded an AUC of 99.7% compared with 88.8% for Agilent processed fold changes. All methods performed well when error was taken into account by t- or z-statistics, AUCs ? 99.8%. A substantial proportion of genes showed dye effects, 43% (99%CI : 39%, 47%). However, these effects were generally small regardless of the pre-processing method. Conclusion
Simple loess normalization without background subtraction resulted in low variance fold changes that more reliably ranked gene expression than the other methods. While t-statistics and other measures that take variation into account, including Agilent's z-statistic, can also be used to reliably select differentially expressed genes, fold changes are a standard measure of differential expression for exploratory work, cross platform comparison, and biological interpretation and can not be entirely replaced. Although dye effects are small for most genes, many array features are affected. Therefore, an experimental design that incorporates dye swaps or a common reference could be valuable.},

Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the oyster genome using short reads and a fosmid-pooling strategy, along with transcriptomes of development and stress response and the proteome of the shell. The oyster genome is highly polymorphic and rich in repetitive sequences, with some transposable elements still actively shaping variation. Transcriptome studies reveal an extensive set of genes responding to environmental stress. The expansion of genes coding for heat shock protein 70 and inhibitors of apoptosis is probably central to the oyster’s adaptation to sessile life in the highly stressful intertidal zone. Our analyses also show that shell formation in molluscs is more complex than currently understood and involves extensive participation of cells and their exosomes. The oyster genome sequence fills a void in our understanding of the Lophotrochozoa.},

Recent studies have shown that oysters pretreated with heat shock can result in induced heat tolerance.

In this study, we performed the first network analysis of oyster transcriptome by reanalyzing microarray data from a previous study. Network analysis revealed a cascade of cellular responses during oyster recovery after heat shock and identified responsive gene modules and key genes. Our study demonstrates the power of network analysis in a non-model organism with poor gene annotations, which can lead to new discoveries that go beyond the focus on individual genes.},

  Abstract                 = {As a benthic filter-feeder of estuaries, the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, faces tremendous exposure to microbial pathogens. How eastern oysters without adaptive immunity survive in pathogen-rich environments is of fundamental interest, but studies on its immune system are hindered by the lack of genomic resources. We sequenced the transcriptome of an adult oyster with short Illumina reads and assembled 66,229 contigs with a N50 length of 1,503 bp. The assembly covered 89.4 % of published ESTs and 97.9 % of mitochondrial genes demonstrating its quality. A set of 39,978 contigs and unigenes (>300 bp) were identified and annotated by searching public databases. Analysis of the gene set yielded a diverse set of 657 genes related to innate immunity, including many pertaining to pattern recognition, effectors, signal transduction, cytokines, and apoptosis. Gene families encoding C1q domain containing proteins, CTLD, IAPs, Ig_I-set, and TRAFs expanded in C. virginica and \textit{Crassostrea gigas}. Many key genes of the apoptosis system including IAP, BAX, BAC-2, caspase, FADD, and TNFR were identified, suggesting C. virginica posses advanced apoptosis and apoptosis-regulating systems. Our results show that short Illumina reads can produce transcriptomes of highly polymorphic genomes with coverage and integrity comparable to that from longer 454 reads. The expansion and high diversity in gene families related to innate immunity, point to a complex defense system in the lophotrochozoan C. virginica, probably in adaptation to a pathogen-rich environment.},

In recent years, streptococcal diseases have severely threatened development of tilapia aquaculture, while effective prevention and control methods have not yet been established. In order to understand the immunological response of tilapia to infection by Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae), this study employed Solexa/Illumina {RNA-seq}and digital gene expression (DGE) technology to investigate changes in the tilapia transcriptome before and after S. agalactiae infection. We obtained 82,799 unigenes (mean size: 618 bp) using de novo assembly. Unigenes were annotated by comparing against databases including Nr, Swissprot, cluster of orthologous groups of proteins, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes, and gene ontology. Combined with DGE technology, transcriptomic changes in tilapia before and after bacteria challenging were examined. A total of 774 significantly up-regulated and 625 significantly down-regulated unigenes were identified, among which 293 were mapped to 181 signaling pathways including 17 immune-related pathways involving 65 differentially expressed genes. We observed a change in the expression of six genes in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and this was subsequently confirmed via quantitative real-time PCR. This comparative study of the tilapia transcriptome before and after S. agalactiae infection identified important differentially-expressed immune-related genes and signaling pathways that will provide useful insights for further analysis of the mechanisms of tilapia defense against S. agalactiae infection.},

We have investigated the action of IL-8 (interleukin-8) mRNA expression in human endothelial cells line-EA.Hy926 under SS at different intensities and duration. Expression increases with time in an intensity dependent manner. With regard to the transcriptional mechanism involved, transient transfection of the human wild-type IL-8 promoter (–162/+44)/luciferase reporter plasmid, or site mutation of one of the binding sites [AP-1 (activator protein 1) or NF-?B (nuclear factor ?B)] in the IL-8 promoter region was investigated. Both AP-1 and NF-?B were essential for SS-activated transcription, with the cells responding to NF-?B activation within minutes. After stimulated at low SS (4.20 dyne/cm2) for 30 min, the P65 subunit was translocated from the cytoplasm to nucleus for at least 60 min, while the cytoplasmic level of I?B (inhibitory ?B) gradually decreased. The combined activation of NF-?B and AP-1 are the upstream regulators of low SS-induced IL-8 production in EA.Hy926 cells, which subsequently trigger an inflammatory reaction in endothelium.},

The deduce amino acid sequence of VpBD shared the common features of big defensin including disulfide array organization and helix structure, indicating that VpBD should be a new member of the big defensin family. The mRNA transcript of VpBD was up-regulated significantly during the first 24 hr after Vibrio anguillarum challenge, which was 7.4-fold increase compared to that of the control group. Then the expression decreased gradually from 24 hr to 96 hr, and the lowest expression level was detected at 96 hr post-infection, which was still 3.9-fold higher than that of control. The mature peptide of VpBD was recombined in Escherichia coli and purified for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. The rVpBD displayed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity towards all tested bacteria with the highest activity against Staphyloccocus aureus and Pseudomonas putida. These results indicated that VpBD was involved in the host immune response against bacterial infection and might contribute to the clearance of invading bacteria.},

  Abstract                 = {Lysozyme is a widely distributed hydrolase possessing lytic activity against bacterial peptidoglycan, which enables it to protect the host against pathogenic infection. In the present study, the c{DNA} of an invertebrate goose-type lysozyme (designated CFLysG) was cloned from Zhikong scallop \textit{Chlamys farreri} by expressed sequence tag (EST) and rapid amplification of c{DNA} ends (RACE) techniques. The full-length c{DNA} of CFLysG consisted of 829 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a poly(A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 603 bp encoding a polypeptide of 200 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 21.92 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point of 7.76. The high similarity of CFLysG with goose-type (g-type) lysozymes in vertebrate indicated that CFLysG should be an invertebrate counterpart of g-type lysozyme family, which suggested that the origin of g-type lysozyme preceded the emergence of urochordates and even preceded the emergence of deuterostomes. Similar to most g-type lysozymes, CFLysG possessed all conserved features critical for the fundamental structure and function of g-type lysozymes, such as three catalytic residues (Glu 82, Asp 97, Asp 108). By Northern blot analysis, mRNA transcript of CFLysG was found to be most abundantly expressed in the tissues of gills, hepatopancreas and gonad, weakly expressed in the tissues of haemocytes and mantle, while undetectable in the adductor muscle. These results suggested that CFLysG could possess combined features of both the immune and digestive adaptive lysozymes. To gain insight into the \textit{in vitro} lytic activities of CFLysG, the mature peptide coding region was cloned into Pichia pastoris for heterogeneous expression. Recombinant CFLysG showed inhibitive effect on the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with more potent activities against Gram-positive bacteria, which indicated the involvement of CFLysG in the innate immunity of C. farreri.},

  Abstract                 = {The Rel/NF-?B transcription factors can function as key regulators to modulate the expression of immune-related genes in response to immune challenge or environmental stress. In the present study, a gene coding Rel/NF-?B homologue was identified from scallop Chlamys farreri (designated CfRel). Its deduced protein comprised 359 amino acids, and contained a conserved N-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD) and an IPT domain. There was an NF-?B/Rel/dorsal domain signature sequence in the RHD domain. The mRNA transcripts of CfRel could be detected in all the tested tissues including adductor muscle, mantle, gill, gonad, haemocytes, kidney and hepatopancreas, with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. After LPS stimulation, there were two peaks of CfRel mRNA expression level in haemocytes at 6 h (25.25-fold, P < 0.05) and 24 h (59.66-fold, P < 0.05) respectively, while the mRNA expression of CfRel was only up-regulated at 3 h after PGN stimulation (2.35-fold, P < 0.05). By Western blotting technique, CfRel protein was observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of scallop haemocytes, and its concentration in the haemocyte nucleus increased significantly at 3 h and 12 h after LPS stimulation. The noticeable NF-?B transcription activity of CfRel protein was determined by NF-?B luciferase reporter assays (122.43%, P < 0.05), and it decreased significantly (17.61%, P < 0.05) after the coexpression of scallop I?B protein. These results collectively suggested that CfRel mRNA transcripts and protein were induced by immune stimulation, and CfRel protein could extricate itself from I?B protein and transfer into the haemocyte nucleus to modulate the immune response in scallop.},
